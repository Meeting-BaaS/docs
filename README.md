## What is Meeting BaaS?

Meeting BaaS provides one API for Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Integrate all of your tools automatically with just two HTTP requests to record meetings across platforms.

## API References

The compiled API reference files in this repository are the official reference for our API endpoints.

You can find them here:

- `/openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification (automatically downloaded from api.meetingbaas.com)
- `/content/docs/api/reference/` - API reference documentation files

### Enhancing Update Files with AI

The project includes an AI-powered enhancement script that uses OpenRouter (with Anthropic's Claude models) to improve automatically generated documentation:

```bash
# Enhance the most recent update file
pnpm enhance:updates --key=your_openrouter_api_key

# Process all update files
pnpm enhance:updates --key=your_openrouter_api_key --all

# and more...
