## Create multiple bots

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/batch-create-bots.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Create multiple bots in a single request with partial success support.
    
    Processes each bot creation request sequentially (index 0, 1, 2...). Each item is validated and processed independently. If some bots fail to create, the request still returns 201 with a `data` array containing successful creations and an `errors` array containing failures. Each error includes the `index` of the failed item in the original request array.
    
    **Processing Order:** Items are processed in the order they appear in the request array. Each item goes through the same validation and checks as a single bot creation: platform detection, BYOK transcription check, daily bot cap check, token availability check, and deduplication lock acquisition.
    
    **Partial Success:** The response always has `success: true`, even if all items fail. Check the `errors` array to identify failed items. The `data` array contains successfully created bots with their `bot_id` and preserved `extra` metadata. The `errors` array contains failed items with `index`, `code`, `message`, `details`, and preserved `extra` metadata.
    
    **Daily Bot Cap:** The daily bot cap is checked per item, not per batch. If the cap is reached mid-batch, subsequent items will fail with `DAILY_BOT_CAP_REACHED` error. The cap is based on bots created in the last 24 hours.
    
    **Token Reservation:** Tokens are reserved individually for each successful bot creation (0.5 tokens per bot). If token availability becomes insufficient mid-batch, subsequent items will fail with `INSUFFICIENT_TOKENS`.
    
    **Error Index Mapping:** Each error includes an `index` field (0-based) that corresponds to the item's position in the request array. Use this to correlate errors with your original request. Validation errors include detailed validation issues in the `details` field.
    
    **Error Isolation:** Each bot creation is processed independently. If one bot creation fails, it does not affect other bots in the batch. Failed items are included in the `errors` array while successful items are in the `data` array.
    
    Returns 201 with partial success response. All items may succeed, all may fail, or any combination. Always check both `data` and `errors` arrays.

## Create multiple scheduled bots

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/batch-create-scheduled-bots.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Create multiple scheduled bots in a single request with partial success support.
    
    Processes each scheduled bot creation request sequentially. Each item is validated and processed independently. Token reservation and daily bot cap checks are NOT performed at creation time - they are performed when each bot actually joins the meeting.
    
    **Processing Order:** Items are processed in the order they appear in the request array. Each item goes through validation: platform detection, BYOK transcription check, and join time validation. Unlike immediate bot creation, daily bot cap and token availability are not checked at creation time.
    
    **Partial Success:** The response always has `success: true`, even if all items fail. Check the `errors` array to identify failed items. The `data` array contains successfully scheduled bots with their `bot_id` and preserved `extra` metadata.
    
    **Join Time Validation:** Each scheduled bot's `join_at` time must be in the future (at least 1 minute ahead). If a join time is invalid, that item will fail with a validation error, but other items will continue processing.
    
    **Error Scenarios:** 
    - Validation errors: Invalid join time, invalid meeting URL, invalid configuration
    - Platform detection failures: `INVALID_MEETING_PLATFORM`
    - BYOK not enabled: `BYOK_TRANSCRIPTION_NOT_ENABLED_ON_PLAN`
    - System failures: `BOT_CREATE_FAILED`
    
    **Note:** Daily bot cap and token availability are checked when each bot joins, not at creation time. If these checks fail at join time, the bot will transition to `failed` status and send a failure webhook.
    
    Returns 201 with partial success response. All items may succeed, all may fail, or any combination.

## Create a bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/create-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Create a bot to join a meeting immediately.
    
    The bot will automatically join the meeting, request recording permissions, and start recording once accepted. You can provide a bot-specific callback URL to receive bot.completed and bot.failed events for this bot (in addition to your account's webhooks). The bot will send webhook events for status changes, completion, and failures.
    
    Returns a `bot_id` (UUID) that you can use to track status, retrieve meeting data, and manage the bot. The bot will be queued immediately and join the meeting as soon as possible (may take up to 2 minutes depending on availability of bot slots).
    
    **Token Reservation:** 0.5 tokens are reserved immediately upon creation. These tokens will be consumed based on the bot's duration and outcome. If the bot fails due to user-responsible errors (`BOT_NOT_ACCEPTED`, `TIMEOUT_WAITING_TO_START`), recording tokens will be charged based on the time spent in the waiting room.
    
    **Deduplication:** By default, multiple bots can join the same meeting URL. Set `allow_multiple_bots: false` to prevent duplicate bots within 5 minutes. The deduplication check expires after 5 minutes, allowing a new bot to join the same meeting URL after that period.
    
    **Rate Limits:** Subject to your API key's rate limits and your team's daily bot cap. The daily bot cap is checked before token reservation. If the cap is reached, the request will fail with a 429 status code.
    
    **Error Scenarios:**
    - `402 Payment Required`: Insufficient tokens available
    - `409 Conflict`: Bot already exists for the same meeting URL (when `allow_multiple_bots` is false)
    - `429 Too Many Requests`: Daily bot cap reached or rate limit exceeded

## Create scheduled bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/create-scheduled-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Schedule a bot to join a meeting at a specific time in the future.
    
    The bot will automatically join the meeting at the specified `join_at` time (ISO 8601 timestamp). You can provide a callback URL to receive events for this bot. The bot configuration is stored immediately, but token reservation and daily bot cap checks are performed when the bot actually joins the meeting.
    
    **Scheduling:** The `join_at` timestamp must be in the future (at least 1 minute ahead). The bot will automatically attempt to join the meeting at the specified time. There may be a small processing delay (typically less than a minute).
    
    **Token Reservation:** Tokens are NOT reserved at creation time. Token availability and daily bot cap are checked when the bot actually joins the meeting. If tokens are insufficient or the daily cap is reached at join time, the bot will fail with an appropriate error and transition to `failed` status.
    
    **Deduplication:** Deduplication is checked when the bot joins, not at creation time. This means you can schedule multiple bots for the same meeting URL, but only one will successfully join (unless `allow_multiple_bots` is true).
    
    **Status:** The scheduled bot starts in `scheduled` status and transitions to `completed` when the bot instance is created and queued to join. If the bot fails to join, it transitions to `failed` status.
    
    **Updates and Deletions:** Scheduled bots can be updated or deleted as long as they are in `scheduled` status and the join time is at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be modified before it starts processing.
    
    Returns a `bot_id` (UUID) that you can use to track and manage the scheduled bot. This UUID will be reused as the bot's UUID when it actually joins.

## Delete bot data

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/delete-bot-data.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Permanently delete all bot data including recordings, transcripts, summaries, and screenshots.
    
    This operation is irreversible. All artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization, screenshots) will be permanently deleted. Optionally delete transcription data from the transcription provider as well using the `delete_transcription` query parameter.
    
    **Data Deletion:** 
    - All artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization, screenshots) are permanently deleted
    - The `artifacts_deleted` field is set to `true`
    - Artifact URLs will return `null` in subsequent API calls
    - Bot metadata remains accessible but all associated data is removed
    
    **Transcription Provider Deletion:** If `delete_transcription=true` is provided, the transcription data will also be deleted from the transcription provider (e.g., Gladia). This requires the bot to have transcription enabled and a transcription provider configured. If the bot uses BYOK transcription, you must have access to the transcription provider API key.
    
    **Irreversible Operation:** Once data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have downloaded or backed up any data you need before calling this endpoint.
    
    **Status:** This operation can be performed on bots in any status. Even if the bot is still recording, the data will be deleted (though new data may continue to be generated until the bot completes).
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Delete scheduled bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/delete-scheduled-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Cancel and delete a scheduled bot.
    
    The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing. Once deleted, the scheduled bot cannot be recovered.
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be deleted via this endpoint. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be cancelled before it starts processing.
    
    **Irreversible Operation:** Once a scheduled bot is deleted, it cannot be recovered. If you need to cancel a bot that is about to join, you should use the leave endpoint on the actual bot instance instead.
    
    **No Token Impact:** Since tokens are not reserved for scheduled bots, deleting a scheduled bot does not affect your token balance.
    
    Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow deletion or the join time is too close.

## Get bot details

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/get-bot-details.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Get comprehensive information about a specific bot.
    
    Returns detailed bot information including current status, configuration, meeting metadata, and presigned URLs for all artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization). Artifact URLs are valid for 4 hours from the time of request. Returns `null` for artifacts if the bot's data has been deleted.
    
    **Artifact URLs:** All artifact URLs (video, audio, transcription, diarization) are presigned URLs that expire after 4 hours. If the bot's data has been deleted (via the delete-data endpoint or data retention policy), these fields will be `null`. The `artifacts_deleted` field indicates whether the bot's data has been permanently removed.
    
    **Status Information:** The response includes the bot's current status (`status` field) and timestamps for key events (joined_at, exited_at, created_at). If the bot failed, the response includes `error_code` and `error_message` fields with details about what went wrong.
    
    **Meeting Metadata:** Includes meeting platform, meeting URL, participants list, speakers list, and meeting duration (if available). Some metadata may be `null` if the bot failed before joining or if the information is not available.
    
    **Transcription Information:** If transcription was enabled, the response includes transcription provider, transcription IDs (for BYOK providers), and URLs to raw and processed transcription files.
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Get bot screenshots

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/get-bot-screenshots.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retrieve a paginated list of screenshot URLs captured during the meeting.
    
    Screenshots are taken periodically during the meeting and can be used to visualize meeting content. Each screenshot is a presigned URL valid for 4 hours.
    
    **Screenshot Availability:** 
    - Screenshots are only available for Google Meet and Microsoft Teams bots
    - Screenshots are only available for bots with `recording_mode` set to `speaker_view` or `gallery_view`
    - Audio-only recordings do not have screenshots
    - Screenshots are captured at regular intervals during the meeting
    
    **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many screenshots are returned per page (default: 50, max: 100).
    
    **URL Expiration:** All screenshot URLs are presigned URLs that expire after 4 hours. If the bot's data has been deleted, this endpoint will return an empty list.
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Get bot status

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/get-bot-status.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Get the current status of a bot, including the latest status code, transcription status, and timestamp.
    
    Useful for polling bot state without fetching the full bot details. Returns lightweight status information including the current status code, transcription status, and when the status was last updated (`updated_at`).
    
    **Response Fields:**
    - `bot_id`: The UUID of the bot
    - `status`: The current bot status (queued, joining, in_call_recording, transcribing, completed, failed)
    - `transcription_status`: The current transcription status (not-applicable, not-started, queued, processing, done, error)
    - `updated_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the status was last updated
    
    **Transcription Status:** The transcription status is fetched in real-time from the transcription provider (e.g., Gladia) if transcription is enabled. This allows you to track transcription progress separately from the bot's overall status.
    
    **Polling Considerations:** 
    - **Not Recommended for Active Monitoring:** Due to the nature of meetings running for extended periods (often hours), frequent polling is not recommended. Instead, use `callback_config` when creating bots or configure webhooks at the account level to receive real-time status updates.
    - **Reconciliation Use Case:** This endpoint is better suited for reconciliation purposes (e.g., checking bot status after a webhook delivery failure or verifying final state).
    - **If Polling is Necessary:** If you must poll, use a judicious interval (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) and implement exponential backoff to avoid rate limits. Consider the meeting duration when determining polling frequency.
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Get scheduled bot details

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/get-scheduled-bot-details.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retrieve detailed information about a specific scheduled bot.
    
    Returns the scheduled bot's configuration, scheduled join time, current status, and associated bot instance (if the bot has already joined). Includes all the same configuration options as immediate bot creation.
    
    **Status Information:** The response includes the scheduled bot's current status (`scheduled`, `completed`, or `failed`) and when the status was last updated. If the bot has joined, the response includes a link to the actual bot instance.
    
    **Scheduled Join Time:** The `join_at` field contains the ISO 8601 timestamp when the bot is scheduled to join the meeting.
    
    **Bot Instance:** If the scheduled bot has transitioned to `completed` status, the bot instance has been created and is queued to join. You can use the `bot_id` (which will be reused as the bot's UUID when it joins) to query the bot's status and retrieve meeting data once it has joined.
    
    **Updates and Deletions:** If the bot is in `scheduled` status and the join time is at least 4 minutes in the future, you can update or delete the scheduled bot. This ensures the bot can be modified before it starts processing.
    
    Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Leave meeting

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/leave-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Instruct a bot to leave the meeting immediately.
    
    The bot will stop recording and processing, then exit the meeting. Only works if the bot is currently in the meeting (status is `in_call_recording` or `transcribing`). The bot will send a final webhook event when it leaves.
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in a state that allows leaving. Bots that have already completed, failed, or are not yet in the meeting cannot be left via this endpoint. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Token Consumption:** When a bot is manually left, tokens are consumed based on the duration from when recording started to when the bot left. The bot will transition to `completed` status and send a completion webhook.
    
    **Immediate Effect:** The leave command is sent to the bot process immediately. The bot will stop recording and exit the meeting as soon as it receives the command (usually within a few seconds).
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation.

## List bots

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/list-bots.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

List all bots for your team with pagination support.
    
    Filter by status (queued, joining, in_call_recording, transcribing, completed, failed), meeting platform (zoom, meet, teams), and date range. Results are ordered by creation date (newest first). Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation through large result sets.
    
    **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The response includes a `next_cursor` if more results are available. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 20, max: 100).
    
    **Filtering:** 
    - `status`: Filter by bot status (comma-separated for multiple statuses)
    - `platform`: Filter by meeting platform (zoom, meet, teams)
    - `created_after`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots created after this time
    - `created_before`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots created before this time
    
    **Date Range:** The `created_after` and `created_before` filters use ISO 8601 timestamps. Results are limited to bots created within the last 90 days by default.
    
    Returns a paginated list of bots with metadata including bot ID, status, meeting platform, creation time, and basic configuration.

## List scheduled bots

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/list-scheduled-bots.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retrieve a paginated list of scheduled bots.
    
    Supports filtering by status (`scheduled`, `completed`, `failed`) and date range. Results are ordered by scheduled join time (earliest first). Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation.
    
    **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 20, max: 100).
    
    **Filtering:**
    - `status`: Filter by scheduled bot status (comma-separated for multiple statuses)
    - `scheduled_after`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots scheduled to join after this time
    - `scheduled_before`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots scheduled to join before this time
    
    **Status Values:**
    - `scheduled`: Bot is scheduled but has not yet joined
    - `completed`: Bot instance was created and queued to join (bot may still be joining)
    - `failed`: Bot failed to join (token issues, daily cap, etc.)
    
    Returns a paginated list of scheduled bots with metadata including bot ID, scheduled join time, status, and basic configuration.

## Resend final webhook

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/resend-final-webhook.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Resend the final webhook (completed or failed) for a bot.
    
    Useful if the webhook delivery failed or you need to reprocess the webhook event. The webhook will be sent to all configured webhook endpoints for your account.
    
    **Webhook Delivery:** The webhook will be sent to all configured webhook endpoints for your account. The webhook payload will be identical to the original final webhook (either `bot.completed` or `bot.failed` event).
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `completed` or `failed` status. Bots that are still in progress cannot have their final webhook resent. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Use Cases:** 
    - Webhook delivery failed due to network issues
    - Webhook endpoint was temporarily unavailable
    - Need to reprocess a webhook event
    - Testing webhook integration
    
    **Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent. You can call it multiple times, and it will resend the webhook each time. There is no limit on how many times you can resend a webhook.
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation.

## Retry callback

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/retry-callback.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retry sending the transcription callback for a bot.
    
    You can override the callback configuration (URL, method, secret) if needed. Only works for bots that have completed or failed. The callback will be sent to the provided URL (or the bot's original callback URL if not overridden).
    
    **Callback Configuration:** You can override the callback URL, HTTP method (POST or PUT), and secret in the request body. If not provided, the bot's original callback configuration will be used. The secret will be included in the `x-mb-secret` header for validation.
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `completed` or `failed` status and must have had transcription enabled. Bots without transcription or bots that are still in progress cannot have their callback retried. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Callback Payload:** The callback payload will be identical to the original callback (either `bot.completed` or `bot.failed` event with transcription data). The payload format matches the webhook format.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Callback delivery failed due to network issues
    - Callback endpoint was temporarily unavailable
    - Need to send callback to a different endpoint
    - Testing callback integration
    
    **Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent. You can call it multiple times with the same or different configurations.
    
    Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation or if no callback was configured.

## Update scheduled bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/bots/update-scheduled-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Update a scheduled bot's configuration or scheduled join time.
    
    The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
    
    **Updateable Fields:** You can update any configuration field (bot name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.) and the scheduled join time (`join_at`). All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated.
    
    **Join Time Requirements:** 
    - The new `join_at` time must be in the future
    - The bot must be in `scheduled` status
    - The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future (lock window)
    - If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be updated. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Validation:** All updated fields are validated using the same rules as bot creation. Invalid configurations will result in a 400 Bad Request error.
    
    Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow update or the join time is too close.

## Schedule bot for calendar event

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/create-calendar-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Schedule a bot to automatically join a calendar event.
    
    You can schedule for all occurrences of a recurring event or specific event instances. The bot will use the meeting URL from the event. Returns partial success if some events fail to schedule (e.g., if a bot is already scheduled or if the event doesn't have a meeting URL).
    
    **Scheduling Options:**
    - `series_id`: Schedule for all occurrences of a recurring series
    - `event_id`: Schedule for a specific event instance
    - `all_occurrences`: Schedule for all future occurrences (for recurring events)
    
    **Meeting URL Requirement:** The event must have a meeting URL. If the event doesn't have a meeting URL, the scheduling will fail for that event. The meeting platform is automatically detected from the URL.
    
    **Bot Configuration:** You can provide bot configuration (name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.) that will be used for all scheduled bots. The configuration applies to all events you're scheduling for.
    
    **Partial Success:** If you're scheduling for multiple events (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some events may fail to schedule (e.g., if a bot is already scheduled). The response includes information about which events succeeded and which failed.
    
    **Token Reservation:** Tokens are NOT reserved at scheduling time. Token availability and daily bot cap are checked when each bot actually joins the meeting. If tokens are insufficient or the daily cap is reached at join time, the bot will fail with an appropriate error.
    
    **Status:** The calendar bot schedule starts in `scheduled` status and transitions to `completed` when the bot instance is created and queued to join. If the bot fails to join, it transitions to `failed` status.
    
    Returns 201 with scheduling results. Returns 404 if the event series or event is not found.

## Create calendar connection

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/create-calendar-connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Connect a Google or Microsoft calendar to your account.
    
    The connection will automatically sync events and create push subscriptions for real-time updates. You must provide your own OAuth credentials (client ID, secret, refresh token). Once connected, the calendar will be synced immediately, and webhook subscriptions will be created for real-time event updates.
    
    **OAuth Credentials:** You must provide valid OAuth credentials for the calendar provider. The endpoint will validate the credentials by attempting to refresh the access token. If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the request will fail with 401 Unauthorized.
    
    **Initial Sync:** After creating the connection, an initial sync is performed automatically. This fetches all events from the calendar provider. The sync may take a few minutes for calendars with many events.
    
    **Push Subscriptions:** A push subscription is created automatically for real-time event updates. The subscription will send webhooks when events are created, updated, or cancelled. Subscriptions expire after a certain period (3 days for Microsoft, longer for Google) and need to be renewed using the resubscribe endpoint.
    
    **Calendar Limits:** There may be limits on the number of calendar connections per team. If the limit is exceeded, the request will fail with 403 Forbidden.
    
    **Duplicate Connections:** If a connection already exists for the same calendar ID and team, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. You can update an existing connection using the PATCH endpoint instead.
    
    Returns 201 with the newly created calendar connection. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 403 if the calendar connection limit is exceeded, or 409 if the connection already exists.

## Cancel calendar bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/delete-calendar-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Cancel one or more scheduled calendar bots.
    
    You can target a single event or all occurrences in a series using `series_id`, `all_occurrences`, and `event_id` in the request body. Bots must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future.
    
    **Cancellation Targets:**
    - `event_id`: Cancel bot for a specific event instance
    - `series_id`: Cancel bots for all occurrences of a series
    - `all_occurrences`: Cancel all future occurrences (for recurring events)
    
    **Status Requirements:** Bots must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be cancelled via this endpoint. If a bot is in an invalid state, that bot will fail to cancel, but other bots may still be cancelled.
    
    **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
    
    **Partial Cancellation:** If cancelling multiple bots (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some bots may fail to cancel (e.g., if they're not in `scheduled` status). The response includes information about which bots were cancelled and which failed.
    
    **Irreversible Operation:** Once a calendar bot is cancelled, it cannot be recovered. If you need to cancel a bot that is about to join, you should use the leave endpoint on the actual bot instance instead.
    
    **No Token Impact:** Since tokens are not reserved for calendar bots, cancelling a bot does not affect your token balance.
    
    Returns 200 with cancellation results. Returns 404 if the event or calendar bot schedule is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow deletion.

## Delete calendar connection

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/delete-calendar-connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Disconnect and delete a calendar connection.
    
    This will stop syncing events and remove all associated calendar data (events, event instances, series). The push subscription will be cancelled automatically. This operation is irreversible.
    
    **Data Deletion:** All calendar data associated with this connection will be deleted:
    - Event series and instances
    - Calendar bot schedules
    - Sync history
    
    **Subscription Cancellation:** The push subscription is cancelled automatically when the connection is deleted. You will no longer receive webhooks for this calendar.
    
    **Irreversible Operation:** Once a calendar connection is deleted, it cannot be recovered. All associated data is permanently removed. If you need to reconnect the calendar, you must create a new connection.
    
    **Bot Schedules:** If there are active calendar bot schedules for events in this calendar, they will be cancelled when the connection is deleted. Bots that have already joined meetings will continue to function normally.
    
    Returns 200 with confirmation of deletion. Returns 404 if the calendar connection is not found or does not belong to your team.

Retrieve detailed information about a specific calendar event.
    
    Returns comprehensive event information including attendees, meeting URL, meeting platform, status, and whether a bot is scheduled. Returns deleted events as well (use the `include_deleted` parameter or check the `deleted_at` field).
    
    **Event Details:** Includes all event metadata:
    - Title, description, location
    - Start and end times (ISO 8601 timestamps)
    - Status (confirmed, cancelled, tentative)
    - Attendees list
    - Meeting URL (if available)
    - Meeting platform (if detected from URL)
    - Whether it's an all-day event
    - Whether it's an exception to a recurring series
    
    **Bot Scheduling:** The `bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a calendar bot schedule exists for this event. If the event is part of a recurring series, the `series_bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a bot is scheduled for all occurrences.
    
    **Deleted Events:** Deleted events are included in the response. Check the `deleted_at` field to determine if an event has been deleted. Deleted events may still have associated bot schedules if they were scheduled before deletion.
    
    Returns 404 if the event is not found or does not belong to the specified calendar.

## List available calendars

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/list-raw-calendars.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Preview available calendars from a Google or Microsoft account before creating a connection.
    
    Requires OAuth credentials (client ID, client secret, refresh token) to authenticate and list calendars. This endpoint does not create a connection - it only lists the calendars that are available for the given OAuth credentials. Useful for allowing users to select which calendars to sync.
    
    **OAuth Credentials:** You must provide valid OAuth credentials for the calendar provider. The endpoint will use the refresh token to obtain an access token and list calendars. If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the request will fail with 401 Unauthorized.
    
    **Calendar Information:** Returns a list of calendars with their IDs, names, descriptions, and whether they are primary calendars. Calendar IDs differ between providers (Google uses email-like IDs, Microsoft uses GUIDs).
    
    **Use Case:** This endpoint is typically called before creating a calendar connection to show users which calendars are available. Users can then select which calendars they want to sync.
    
    Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, or 403 if a Microsoft account license is required.

## Resubscribe to calendar webhooks

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/resubscribe-calendar.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Renew or recreate the push subscription for a calendar connection.
    
    Useful when subscriptions expire or need to be refreshed. A new subscription will be created and the old one will be cancelled. Subscriptions expire after a certain period (3 days for Microsoft, longer for Google) and need to be renewed periodically.
    
    **Subscription Renewal:** The endpoint creates a new push subscription with the calendar provider. The old subscription is cancelled to prevent duplicate webhooks. The new subscription will send webhooks for all calendar events (created, updated, cancelled).
    
    **Subscription Expiration:** Subscriptions expire automatically after a certain period:
    - Microsoft: 3 days maximum
    - Google: Longer period (varies)
    
    When a subscription expires, you will stop receiving webhook notifications. Use this endpoint to renew the subscription before it expires.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Subscription is about to expire
    - Subscription has expired and webhooks stopped working
    - Need to refresh subscription for troubleshooting
    
    **Response:** The response includes information about the new subscription, including when it was created and when it expires.
    
    Returns 200 with subscription information. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 403 if permission is denied, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.

## Sync calendar events

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/sync-calendar.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Manually trigger a sync of calendar events.
    
    This will fetch all events from the calendar provider and update the calendar data. Events are normally synced automatically via push subscriptions, but you can use this endpoint to force a sync (e.g., after fixing connection errors or when you need immediate updates).
    
    **Sync Process:** The sync process fetches all events from the calendar provider. New events are added, updated events are modified, and cancelled events are marked as deleted. The sync may take a few minutes for calendars with many events.
    
    **Incremental vs Full Sync:** The endpoint performs a full sync, fetching all events from the calendar. Incremental syncs happen automatically via push subscriptions when events are created, updated, or cancelled.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Force a sync after fixing connection errors
    - Get immediate updates without waiting for push notifications
    - Recover from missed push notifications
    - Initial sync after creating a connection (though this happens automatically)
    
    **Response:** The response includes information about the sync operation, including how many events were synced. The actual event data is available via the list events endpoint.
    
    Returns 200 with sync results. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.

## Update calendar bot

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/update-calendar-bot.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Update one or more calendar bots for a calendar.
    
    You can target a single event or all occurrences in a series using `series_id`, `all_occurrences`, and `event_id` in the request body. The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future.
    
    **Update Targets:**
    - `event_id`: Update bot for a specific event instance
    - `series_id`: Update bots for all occurrences of a series
    - `all_occurrences`: Update all future occurrences (for recurring events)
    
    **Updateable Fields:** You can update any bot configuration field (bot name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.). All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated.
    
    **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be updated. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
    
    **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
    
    **Partial Updates:** If updating multiple bots (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some bots may fail to update (e.g., if they're not in `scheduled` status). The response includes information about which bots were updated and which failed.
    
    Returns 200 with update results. Returns 404 if the event or calendar bot schedule is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow update.

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/calendars/update-calendar-connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Update a calendar connection with new OAuth credentials.
    
    Useful when refresh tokens expire or credentials need to be rotated. The connection will be validated and a new push subscription will be created. The old subscription will be cancelled automatically.
    
    **OAuth Credentials:** You can update the client ID, client secret, and refresh token. All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated. The endpoint will validate the new credentials by attempting to refresh the access token.
    
    **Validation:** After updating credentials, the connection is validated by attempting to refresh the access token. If the refresh fails, the connection status is updated to `error` and the request may fail with 401 Unauthorized.
    
    **Subscription Renewal:** A new push subscription is created automatically after updating credentials. The old subscription is cancelled to prevent duplicate webhooks.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Refresh token expired and needs to be renewed
    - OAuth credentials rotated for security
    - Fixing connection errors by updating credentials
    
    Returns 200 with the updated calendar connection. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 403 if permission is denied, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.
