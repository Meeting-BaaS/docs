## Create a Zoom credential

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/zoom-credentials/createZoomCredential.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Create a new Zoom credential for your team.

    Zoom credentials store your Zoom OAuth App credentials (client_id and client_secret) securely encrypted. You can create two types of credentials:

    **App-only credentials:** Provide only `name`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`. These credentials can be used for SDK authentication when bots join meetings.

    **User-authorized credentials:** Additionally provide `authorization_code` and `redirect_uri`. The API will exchange the authorization code for OAuth tokens, enabling OBF (On-Behalf-Of) token support. OBF tokens allow bots to join meetings on behalf of a specific Zoom user.

    **Security:** All credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Client secrets and OAuth tokens are never returned in API responses.

    **OAuth Flow:** To obtain an authorization code, redirect users to Zoom's OAuth authorization endpoint and capture the code from the callback. Ensure your redirect URI exactly matches the one registered in your Zoom OAuth App.

    **Error Scenarios:**
    - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input or missing redirect_uri when authorization_code is provided
    - `400 Bad Request`: Failed to exchange authorization code (invalid code or redirect_uri mismatch)

## Delete a Zoom credential

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/zoom-credentials/deleteZoomCredential.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Delete a Zoom credential (soft delete).

    The credential is marked as deleted and will no longer appear in list responses. Bots currently using this credential will fail to fetch OBF tokens.

    **Impact on Bots:** If bots are configured to use this credential (via `zoom_config.credential_id`), they will fail with an error when trying to fetch OBF tokens. Make sure to update any bot configurations before deleting a credential.

    **Soft Delete:** The credential is soft-deleted and can potentially be restored by support if needed. All associated encrypted data remains in the database.

    Returns 404 if the credential is not found or does not belong to your team.

## Get a Zoom credential

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/zoom-credentials/getZoomCredential.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Get detailed information about a specific Zoom credential.

    Returns the credential's metadata including its current state and any recent errors. Sensitive fields (client_secret, OAuth tokens) are never included.

    **Error Tracking:** The `last_error_message` and `last_error_at` fields show the most recent OBF token fetch failure. Check these fields if bots using this credential are failing to join meetings.

    Returns 404 if the credential is not found or does not belong to your team.

## List Zoom credentials

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/zoom-credentials/listZoomCredentials.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

List all Zoom credentials for your team.

    Returns all non-deleted credentials with their metadata. Sensitive fields (client_secret, OAuth tokens) are never included in responses.

    **Response Fields:**
    - `credential_id`: UUID to reference this credential in bot requests
    - `name`: User-friendly name for identification
    - `credential_type`: "app" (SDK only) or "user" (with OAuth tokens)
    - `zoom_user_id`: The Zoom user ID (only for "user" type)
    - `state`: "active" or "invalid"
    - `last_error_message`: Last OBF token fetch error (if any)

    **Error Tracking:** If bots fail to fetch OBF tokens using a credential, the error is recorded in `last_error_message` and `last_error_at`. These fields are cleared on successful OBF token fetch.

## Update a Zoom credential

### Source: ./content/docs/api-v2/reference/zoom-credentials/updateZoomCredential.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Update an existing Zoom credential.

    You can update the credential name, SDK credentials (client_id/client_secret), or re-authorize with new OAuth tokens.

    **Updating Name:** Provide only `name` to rename the credential.

    **Updating SDK Credentials:** Provide both `client_id` and `client_secret` together to update the SDK credentials.

    **Re-authorizing:** Provide `authorization_code`, `redirect_uri`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` to exchange a new authorization code for fresh OAuth tokens. This also resets the credential state to "active" and clears any error messages.

    **Error Scenarios:**
    - `400 Bad Request`: Missing redirect_uri when authorization_code is provided
    - `400 Bad Request`: Failed to exchange authorization code
    - `404 Not Found`: Credential not found or does not belong to your team
