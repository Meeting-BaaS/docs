## Create Zoom OAuth Connection

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/zoom--o-auth/create_zoom_oauth_connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Exchanges a Zoom OAuth authorization code for access and refresh tokens, retrieves the Zoom user's profile, and stores the connection for managed OBF token generation. The authorization code is obtained by directing a Zoom user through the OAuth consent flow for your Zoom OAuth app. Once stored, you can reference this connection's `zoom_user_id` as the `zoom_obf_token_user_id` parameter when creating a bot, and the system will automatically fetch a fresh OBF token at join time. Note: the authorization code is single-use and expires in approximately 10 minutes.

## Delete Zoom OAuth Connection

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/zoom--o-auth/delete_zoom_oauth_connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Permanently deletes a Zoom OAuth connection by its UUID, removing all stored tokens. After deletion, bots using this connection's `zoom_user_id` as `zoom_obf_token_user_id` will no longer be able to automatically fetch OBF tokens. The Zoom user would need to re-authorize to create a new connection.

## Get Zoom OAuth Connection

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/zoom--o-auth/get_zoom_oauth_connection.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retrieves a specific Zoom OAuth connection by its UUID. Returns the connection details including the Zoom user ID, account ID, connection state, and granted scopes. Sensitive token data is never included in the response.

## List Zoom OAuth Connections

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/zoom--o-auth/list_zoom_oauth_connections.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Retrieves all Zoom OAuth connections associated with the authenticated account. Each connection represents a Zoom user who has authorized your app via OAuth. Use this to display connected users or to find the `zoom_user_id` needed for the `zoom_obf_token_user_id` bot parameter. Sensitive token data is never included in the response.
