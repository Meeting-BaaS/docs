## Create Calendar

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/calendars/create_calendar.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Integrates a new calendar with the system using OAuth credentials. This endpoint establishes a connection with the calendar provider (Google, Microsoft), sets up webhook notifications for real-time updates, and performs an initial sync of all calendar events. It requires OAuth credentials (client ID, client secret, and refresh token) and the platform type. Once created, the calendar is assigned a unique UUID that should be used for all subsequent operations. Returns the newly created calendar object with all integration details.

## Delete Calendar

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/calendars/delete_calendar.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Permanently removes a calendar integration by its UUID, including all associated events and bot configurations. This operation cancels any active subscriptions with the calendar provider, stops all webhook notifications, and unschedules any pending recordings. All related resources are cleaned up in the database. This action cannot be undone, and subsequent requests to this calendar's UUID will return 404 Not Found errors.

## Calendar Webhook Events Documentation

### Source: ./content/docs/api/reference/webhooks/calendar_webhook_documentation.mdx


{/* This file was generated by Fumadocs. Do not edit this file directly. Any changes should be made by running the generation command again. */}

Meeting BaaS sends the following webhook events related to calendar integrations.

## Calendar Webhook Event Types

### 1. `calendar.sync_events`
Sent when calendar events are synced with external providers.

**Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  \"event\": \"calendar.sync_events\",
  \"data\": {
    \"calendar_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
    \"last_updated_ts\": \"2023-05-01T12:00:00Z\",
    \"affected_event_uuids\": [
      \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001\",
      \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174002\"
    ]
  }
}
```

**When it's triggered:**
- After initial calendar connection is established
- When external calendar providers (Google, Microsoft) send change notifications
- After manual calendar resync operations
- During scheduled periodic syncs
- When events are created, updated, or deleted in the source calendar

**What to do with it:**
- Update your local copy of calendar events
- Process any new events that match your criteria
- Remove any deleted events from your system
- Update schedules for any modified events
- Refresh your UI to show the latest calendar data

**Field details:**
- `calendar_id`: The UUID of the synchronized calendar
- `last_updated_ts`: ISO-8601 timestamp when the sync occurred
- `affected_event_uuids**: Array of UUIDs for events that were changed

## Integration with Meeting BaaS Calendar API

After receiving a calendar webhook event, you can:
1. Use the `/calendar_events` endpoint to retrieve detailed information about specific events
2. Use the `/calendars/:uuid` endpoint to get calendar metadata
3. Schedule recording bots for any new meetings with the `/calendar_events/:uuid/bot` endpoint

## Webhook Usage Tips

- Each event includes affected event UUIDs for efficient processing
- You don't need to retrieve all calendar events - just process the changed ones
- The timestamp helps determine the sequence of updates
- For high-frequency calendars, consider batch processing of multiple events

For security, always validate the API key in the `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header matches your API key.

<APIPage document={"./openapi.json"} operations={[{"path":"/bots/webhooks/calendar","method":"get"}]} webhooks={[]} hasHead={false} />

    \"audio\": \"https://storage.example.com/recordings/audio123.wav?token=abc\",
    \"event\": \"complete\"
  }
}
```

The `complete` event includes:
- **bot_id**: Unique identifier for the bot that completed recording
- **speakers**: A set of speaker names identified in the meeting
- **transcript**: Full transcript data with speaker identification and word timing
- **mp4**: URL to the recording file (valid for 24 hours by default)

- `authentication_error`: Failed to authenticate with the meeting platform
- `network_error`: Network connectivity issues during recording
- `internal_error`: Internal server error

### 3. `calendar.sync_events`
Sent when calendar events are synced. Contains information about which events were updated.
```json
{
  \"event\": \"calendar.sync_events\",
  \"data\": {
    \"calendar_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
    \"last_updated_ts\": \"2023-05-01T12:00:00Z\",
    \"affected_event_uuids\": [
      \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001\",
      \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174002\"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `calendar.sync_events` event includes:
- **calendar_id**: UUID of the calendar that was synced
- **last_updated_ts**: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the sync occurred
- **affected_event_uuids**: Array of UUIDs for calendar events that were added, updated, or deleted

This event is triggered when:
- Calendar data is synced with the external provider (Google, Microsoft)
- Multiple events may be created, updated, or deleted in a single sync operation
- Use this event to update your local cache of calendar events

### 4. `transcription_complete`
Sent when transcription is completed separately from recording (e.g., after retranscribing).
```json
{
  \"event\": \"transcription_complete\",
  \"data\": {
    \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\"
  }
}
```

The `transcription_complete` event includes:
- **bot_id**: Unique identifier for the bot with the completed transcription

This event is sent when:
- You request a retranscription via the `/bots/retranscribe` endpoint
- An asynchronous transcription process completes after the recording has ended

## Setting Up Webhooks

You can configure webhooks in two ways:
1. **Account-level webhook URL**: Set a default webhook URL for all bots in your account using the `/accounts/webhook_url` endpoint
2. **Bot-specific webhook URL**: Provide a `webhook_url` parameter when creating a bot with the `/bots` endpoint

Your webhook endpoint must:
- Accept POST requests with JSON payload
- Return a 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt
- Process requests within 10 seconds to avoid timeouts
- Handle each event type appropriately based on the event type

All webhook requests include:
- `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header with your API key for verification
- `content-type: application/json` header
- JSON body containing the event details

## Webhook Reliability

If your endpoint fails to respond or returns an error, the system will attempt to retry the webhook delivery. For critical events, we recommend implementing:

- Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate processing of the same event
- Proper logging of webhook receipts for audit purposes
- Asynchronous processing to quickly acknowledge receipt before handling the event data

For security, always validate the API key in the `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header matches your API key.
