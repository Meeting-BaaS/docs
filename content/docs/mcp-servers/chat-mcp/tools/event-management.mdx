## Error Handling

Event management operations include comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
try {
  const response = await server.tools.eventOperation(params);
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Event operation failed:", error);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```

## Response Handling

Event management tools return structured responses that should be handled appropriately:

```typescript
interface EventResponse {
  content: Array<{
    type: string;
    text: string;
  }>;
  isError?: boolean;
}
```

### Success Response Example
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Successfully scheduled recording for event"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Response Example
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Failed to schedule recording: Event not found"
    }
  ],
  "isError": true
}
```
