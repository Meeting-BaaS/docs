## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect with other services. For Meeting BaaS, an MCP server helps with:

- Meeting transcripts and analysis
- Meeting scheduling
- AI assistance during meetings
- Secure connections
- Enterprise-ready infrastructure
