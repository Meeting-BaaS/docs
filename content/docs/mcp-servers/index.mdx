## What is Model Context Protocol?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-model-context-protocol) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants like Claude to securely connect with external data sources and tools. MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to:

- Access data from various repositories
- Use tools to take actions in external systems
- Maintain context when working across different applications

MCP follows a client-server architecture where AI assistants (clients) connect to lightweight servers that expose specific capabilities through a standardized interface.

## Meeting BaaS MCP Servers

Meeting BaaS offers two MCP server options to help you integrate AI capabilities with your meeting management:
