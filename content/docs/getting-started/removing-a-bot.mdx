# Removing a bot

If you want to remove a bot from a meeting, send a DELETE request to [https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots](https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots) with the bot identifier:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.spoke.app/bots/YOUR_BOT_ID"
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "x-spoke-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Both API keys and bot ID are mandatory.\
\
The bot will leave the meeting and you will get the meeting data up to this point.

Expect us to reply simply with:

```http
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json

{ "ok": true }
```
