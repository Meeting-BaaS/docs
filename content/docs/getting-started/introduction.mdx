**Deploy AI for video meetings through a single unified API.**

**Meeting Baas** üêü provides *Meetings Bots As A Service*, with integrated transcription.

This allows you to:

1. **interact with**
2. **transcribe**
3. **AI summarize**

video-meetings through a single unified API. Using Meeting Baas, you can deploy bots on Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom in less than 1 minute.

Our meeting bots behave just like any other attendee of a meeting ‚Äì except they won‚Äôt talk. *For now.*

Bots can hear and see other people talking, read and write in the chat, and present themselves with a name and a profile picture.

Just provide a meeting URL through a simple command, and meeting bots will connect to the meeting, give their name and ask to be let in.

Once inside, they record the meeting until it ends, and provide you with the data as they go.
