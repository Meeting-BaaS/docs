          Meeting BaaS sends the following webhook events related to calendar
          integrations.


          ## Calendar Webhook Event Types


          ### 1. `calendar.sync_events`

          Sent when calendar events are synced with external providers.


          **Payload Structure:**

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"calendar.sync_events\",
            \"data\": {
              \"calendar_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"last_updated_ts\": \"2023-05-01T12:00:00Z\",
              \"affected_event_uuids\": [
                \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001\",
                \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174002\"
              ]
            }
          }

          ```


          **When it's triggered:**

          - After initial calendar connection is established

          - When external calendar providers (Google, Microsoft) send change
          notifications

          - After manual calendar resync operations

          - During scheduled periodic syncs

          - When events are created, updated, or deleted in the source calendar


          **What to do with it:**

          - Update your local copy of calendar events

          - Process any new events that match your criteria

          - Remove any deleted events from your system

          - Update schedules for any modified events

          - Refresh your UI to show the latest calendar data


          **Field details:**

          - `calendar_id`: The UUID of the synchronized calendar

          - `last_updated_ts`: ISO-8601 timestamp when the sync occurred

          - `affected_event_uuids`: Array of UUIDs for events that were changed


          ## Integration with Meeting BaaS Calendar API


          After receiving a calendar webhook event, you can:

          1. Use the `/calendar_events` endpoint to retrieve detailed
          information about specific events

          2. Use the `/calendars/{uuid}` endpoint to get calendar metadata

          3. Schedule recording bots for any new meetings with the
          `/calendar_events/{uuid}/bot` endpoint


          ## Webhook Usage Tips


          - Each event includes affected event UUIDs for efficient processing

          - You don't need to retrieve all calendar events - just process the
          changed ones

          - The timestamp helps determine the sequence of updates

          - For high-frequency calendars, consider batch processing of multiple
          events


          For security, always validate the API key in the
          `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header matches your API key.
