          Permanently deletes a Zoom OAuth connection by its UUID, removing all
          stored tokens. After deletion, bots using this connection's
          `zoom_user_id` as `zoom_obf_token_user_id` will no longer be able to
          automatically fetch OBF tokens. The Zoom user would need to
          re-authorize to create a new connection.
