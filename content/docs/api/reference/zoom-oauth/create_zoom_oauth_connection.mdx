          Exchanges a Zoom OAuth authorization code for access and refresh
          tokens, retrieves the Zoom user's profile, and stores the connection
          for managed OBF token generation. The authorization code is obtained
          by directing a Zoom user through the OAuth consent flow for your Zoom
          OAuth app. Once stored, you can reference this connection's
          `zoom_user_id` as the `zoom_obf_token_user_id` parameter when creating
          a bot, and the system will automatically fetch a fresh OBF token at
          join time. Note: the authorization code is single-use and expires in
          approximately 10 minutes.
