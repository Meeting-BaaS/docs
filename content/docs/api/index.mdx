**Meeting BaaS** üêü provides _Meetings Bots As A Service_, with integrated transcription.

This allows you to:

1. **interact with**
2. **transcribe**
3. **AI summarize**

video-meetings through a single unified API. Using Meeting Baas, you can deploy bots on Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom in less than 1 minute.

Our meeting bots act as regular meeting participants with full audio and visual capabilities.

They can listen, speak, use chat, and appear with customizable names and profile pictures.

Just provide a meeting URL through a simple command, and meeting bots will connect to the meeting, give their name and ask to be let in.

Once inside, they record the meeting until it ends, and provide you with the data as they go.
