> These updates were introduced on the 27th of February 2025.

We're excited to announce significant improvements to our platform stability and the introduction of new API capabilities.

## Platform Stability Improvements

### Teams & Google Meet Enhancement

- Complete engine rewrite for both Teams and Google Meet platforms
- Migrated from Puppeteer to Playwright for improved stability
- Significantly enhanced performance and reliability
- Successfully tested with extended runtime (15+ hours) showing excellent stability

## New API Features

### New Retranscribe Endpoint

- Introduced new [`POST /bots/retranscribe`](/docs/api/reference/retranscribe_bot) endpoint
- Allows transcription or retranscription of a bot's audio
- Supports both default and custom speech-to-text providers
- Flexible webhook configuration for processing notifications

### Join Endpoint Enhancement

- Added `audio_only` parameter to [`POST /bots`](/docs/api/reference/join) endpoint
- Enables audio-only participation in meetings
- Optimized for scenarios requiring only audio capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Retranscribe API

The new retranscribe endpoint accepts the following parameters:

- `bot_uuid`: Identifier for the target bot
- `provider`: Choice of speech-to-text provider
- `webhook_url`: Optional callback URL for completion notifications

<Callout type="info">
  The retranscribe feature is particularly useful for: - Improving existing
  transcriptions - Using different speech-to-text providers - Recovering from
  any transcription issues
</Callout>

## Future Enhancements

We're actively working on expanding the capabilities of the retranscribe endpoint:

- Additional speech-to-text providers will be supported in upcoming releases
- Custom provider parameters will be exposed through a flexible JSON configuration field
- This will enable fine-tuned control over transcription settings and provider-specific features

## Migration Guide

No breaking changes were introduced with these updates. All new features are additive and backward compatible with existing implementations.

## Implementation Timeline

These changes are now live in production and available for immediate use.
