Meeting Baas allows you to automatically sync calendars from Microsoft Teams and Google Meet to automatically deploy bots to scheduled meetings. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Calendar Integration

First, create a new calendar integration by calling the [Create Calendar](/docs/api/reference/create_calendar) endpoint with your OAuth credentials:

- For Microsoft Teams: Provide Microsoft OAuth token
- For Google Meet: Provide Google OAuth token

This will establish the connection between Meeting Baas and your calendar provider.

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Calendar Status

You can check the status of your calendar integrations using:

- [List Calendars](/docs/api/reference/list_calendars) - View all configured calendars
- [Get a Calendar](/docs/api/reference/get_calendar) - Check specific calendar details
- [List Raw Calendars](/docs/api/reference/list_raw_calendars) - View unprocessed calendar data

<Callout>
Monitor the sync status to ensure your calendar integration is working correctly.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor Calendar Events

Once connected, you can:

- [List Events](/docs/api/reference/list_events) - View all upcoming calendar events
- [Get Event](/docs/api/reference/get_event) - Check specific event details including meeting links and recording status

Meeting Baas will automatically detect meeting links in calendar events and can deploy bots according to your settings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Webhook Updates

Meeting Baas will send updates to your configured webhook whenever:

- New meetings are scheduled
- Meetings are updated or rescheduled
- Meetings are cancelled
- Bot recording status changes

<Callout type="info">
Make sure your webhook endpoint is configured to handle these updates appropriately.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Managing Calendar Integration

You can manage your calendar integration using:

- [Delete a Calendar](/docs/api/reference/delete_calendar) - Remove calendar integration when needed
- Update calendar settings through the dashboard

</Step>

</Steps>

## Next Steps

After setting up calendar sync, you can:

1. Configure automatic bot deployment rules
2. Set up recording preferences
3. Manage meeting data retention settings
