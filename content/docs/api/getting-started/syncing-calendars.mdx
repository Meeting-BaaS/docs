Meeting Baas allows you to automatically sync calendars from Outlook and Google Workspace to automatically deploy bots to scheduled meetings. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1. Authentication

To start syncing calendars, you'll need:

- For Outlook: Microsoft OAuth token, Client ID, and Client Secret
- For Google Workspace: Google OAuth token, Client ID, and Client Secret

Create a new calendar integration by calling the <a href="/docs/api/reference/create_calendar" target="_blank">Create Calendar</a> endpoint with these credentials.

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Managing Calendars

Once authenticated, you can manage your calendars:

- List Calendars: <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_calendars" target="_blank">List Calendars</a> - View all your synced calendars
- Get Calendar Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/get_calendar" target="_blank">Get Calendar Details</a> - Check sync status
- List Raw Calendars: <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_raw_calendars" target="_blank">List Raw Calendars</a> - View available calendars before authentication

<Callout>
Regular monitoring ensures your calendar integration remains active and synced.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Event Management

Monitor and manage calendar events:

- List Events: <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_events" target="_blank">List Events</a> - See all upcoming meetings
- Get Event Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/get_event" target="_blank">Get Event Details</a> - View meeting info and bot status

Meeting Baas automatically detects meeting links and can deploy bots based on your configuration.

#### Recording Management

You can schedule or cancel recording events for specific calendar events:

- Schedule Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/schedule_record_event" target="_blank">Schedule Record Event</a> - Configure a bot to record a specific event
- Cancel Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/unschedule_record_event" target="_blank">Unschedule Record Event</a> - Cancel a scheduled recording

<Callout type="warning">
  When scheduling a recording, the bot will automatically join the meeting at
  the scheduled time and begin recording based on your configuration.
</Callout>

The recording configuration supports the same options as manual bot deployment:

- Speaker view recording
- Gallery view recording
- Audio-only recording
- Speech-to-text transcription
- Custom bot names and images
- Entry messages

<Callout>
  Remember to handle webhook notifications to track the recording status and
  receive the final recording data. These updates can be used to determine
  whether to record new or updated meetings.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### 4. Webhook Integration

Your webhook endpoint will receive updates for:

- New meeting schedules
- Meeting changes or cancellations
- Bot status changes
- Recording status updates

Each webhook notification includes a `last_updated_at` timestamp that you can use to track changes. To get the full details of updated events:

1. Extract the `last_updated_at` timestamp from the webhook payload
2. Call the <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_events" target="_blank">List Events</a> endpoint with the `updated_at_gte` parameter
3. Process the returned list of new or updated events

<Callout type="warning" border={true}>
  This allows to:

- Track all calendar changes in real-time

- Decide whether to record new or modified meetings

- Keep your system synchronized with the latest meeting data

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Configure your webhook endpoint to process these real-time updates and implement
  appropriate retry logic for reliability.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### 5. Cleanup

To remove a calendar integration, use the <a href="/docs/api/reference/delete_calendar" target="_blank">Delete Calendar</a> endpoint.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

After configuring calendar sync:

1. Set up bot deployment rules
2. Configure recording
