Meeting Baas allows you to automatically sync calendars from Outlook and Google Workspace to automatically deploy bots to scheduled meetings. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Authentication: Get your OAuth credentials

To start syncing calendars, you'll need two sets of credentials:

1. **Your App's Credentials (Service Level)**

- For Outlook: Your app's Microsoft Client ID and Client Secret
- For Google Workspace: Your app's Google Client ID and Client Secret

2. **End User's Credentials (User Level)**

- OAuth refresh token obtained when user grants calendar access to your app

<Callout type="info">
  Best Practice: Request calendar access as a separate step after initial user
  signup. Users are more likely to grant calendar access when it's clearly tied
  to a specific feature they want to use.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Optional: List Raw Calendars

Before syncing calendars, you can use the <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_raw_calendars" target="_blank">List Raw Calendars</a> endpoint to view all your user's available calendars. This is particularly useful when a user has multiple calendars and you need to choose which ones to sync.

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Calendar Integration

Create a new calendar integration by calling the <a href="/docs/api/reference/create_calendar" target="_blank">Create Calendar</a> endpoint with the previously obtained credentials.

And an optional `raw_calendar_ID` to choose which calendar to sync. If this parameter is not provided, Meeting Baas will sync the user's primary calendar.

</Step>

<Step>
### Managing Calendars

Once authenticated, you can manage your calendars:

- List Calendars: <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_calendars" target="_blank">List Calendars</a> - View all your synced calendars
- Get Calendar Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/get_calendar" target="_blank">Get Calendar Details</a> - Check sync status

<Callout type="info">
After initial setup, Meeting BaaS handles all calendar API interactions. You only need to respond to webhook events for calendar changes.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Event Management

Monitor and manage calendar events:

- List Events: <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_events" target="_blank">List Events</a> - See all upcoming meetings
- Get Event Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/get_event" target="_blank">Get Event Details</a> - View meeting info and bot status

Meeting Baas automatically detects meeting links and can deploy bots based on your configuration.

#### Recording Management

You can schedule or cancel recording events for specific calendar events:

- Schedule Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/schedule_record_event" target="_blank">Schedule Record Event</a> - Configure a bot to record a specific event
- Cancel Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/unschedule_record_event" target="_blank">Unschedule Record Event</a> - Cancel a scheduled recording

<Callout type="warn">
  When scheduling a recording, the bot will automatically join the meeting at
  the scheduled time and begin recording based on your configuration.
</Callout>

The recording configuration supports the same options as manual bot deployment:

- Speaker view recording
- Gallery view recording
- Audio-only recording
- Speech-to-text transcription
- Custom bot names and images
- Entry messages

<Callout type="info">
  Remember to handle webhook notifications to track the recording status and
  receive the final recording data. These updates can be used to determine
  whether to record new or updated meetings.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Webhook Integration

In addition to live meeting events via the <a href="/docs/api/getting-started/getting-the-data" target="_blank">Live Meeting Updates</a>, your webhook endpoint will receive calendar sync events with the type `calendar.sync_events`. These events notify you about:

- New meeting schedules
- Meeting changes or cancellations
- Calendar sync status updates

Each webhook notification includes:

- An event type of `calendar.sync_events`
- A `last_updated_at` timestamp for tracking changes

1. Extract the `last_updated_at` timestamp from the webhook payload
2. Call the <a href="/docs/api/reference/list_events" target="_blank">List Events</a> endpoint with the `updated_at_gte` parameter equal to the `last_updated_at` timestamp
3. From there, you can apply your business logic to choose whether or not to record the event, using previously mentionned <a href="/docs/api/reference/schedule_record_event" target="_blank">Schedule Record Event</a> / <a href="/docs/api/reference/unschedule_record_event" target="_blank">Unschedule Record Event</a> endpoints.

<Callout type="warn">
  This allows you to:

- Track all calendar changes in real-time

- Decide whether to record new or modified meetings

- Keep your system synchronized with the latest meeting data

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Configure your webhook endpoint to process these real-time updates and implement
  appropriate retry logic for reliability.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Cleanup

To remove a calendar integration, use the <a href="/docs/api/reference/delete_calendar" target="_blank">Delete Calendar</a> endpoint.

</Step>
