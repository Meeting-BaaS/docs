# Setting Up a Zoom App

This guide walks through creating a Zoom app on the Zoom App Marketplace. You will use this app to either:

- Use SDK credentials for internal meetings (no OBF tokens needed)
- Implement OAuth for OBF tokens when joining external meetings

## Prerequisites

- A Zoom account (free or paid works)
- Access to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)

## Creating Your Zoom App

<Steps>
<Step>
### Go to the Zoom App Marketplace

Navigate to [marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and sign in. Click **Develop** in the top navigation, then **Build App**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Select General App

Choose **General App** as the app type. This is the unified app type that supports both OAuth and Meeting SDK.

Give your app a descriptive name (e.g., "Acme Recording Bot").

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Basic Information

Fill out the **Basic Information** section:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| App Name | Your app's display name |
| Short Description | Brief description of what your app does |
| Long Description | Detailed description (required for Marketplace listing) |
| Company Name | Your organization name |
| Developer Name | Primary contact name |
| Developer Email | Primary contact email |

**OAuth Redirect URL:** Enter the URL where you will handle OAuth callbacks. If you are only using SDK credentials without OAuth, you can set this to your app's home page (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/dashboard`).

</Step>

<Step>
### Enable Meeting SDK

Navigate to **Features** → **Embed** in the sidebar.

Toggle **Meeting SDK** to **On**.

This enables your app to join meetings using the Zoom Meeting SDK.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Scopes

Navigate to **Scopes** in the sidebar.

**Default scope:** When you enable Meeting SDK, Zoom automatically adds `user:read:zak`. This is required by the Meeting SDK toggle.

**Additional scopes:** Depending on your integration, you may need to add more scopes. Use this matrix to determine what you need:

| Integration Type | `user:read:zak` | `user:read:token` | `user:read:user` |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SDK credentials only** (internal meetings) | ✓ Auto-added | Not needed | Not needed |
| **OBF: Direct token** (you fetch tokens yourself) | ✓ Auto-added | You add to your app | You add to your app |
| **OBF: Token URL** (you host an endpoint) | ✓ Auto-added | You add to your app | You add to your app |
| **OBF: Managed OAuth** (Meeting BaaS stores tokens) | ✓ Auto-added | ✓ Required | ✓ Required |

<Callout>
**Which integration type should I use?**
- **Internal meetings only:** Use SDK credentials. No additional scopes needed.
- **External meetings, you manage OAuth:** Use Direct token or Token URL. Add scopes to your Zoom app.
- **External meetings, we manage OAuth:** Use Managed OAuth. Add both `user:read:token` and `user:read:user`.

See [OBF Token Support](/docs/api/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) for details on each option.
</Callout>

To add scopes, click **Add Scopes**, search for the scope name, and add it.

</Step>

<Step>
### Get Your Credentials

**OAuth credentials** (for OBF tokens):

Navigate to **Basic Information** to find:
- **Client ID** — Used in OAuth authorization URL
- **Client Secret** — Used when exchanging authorization codes

**SDK credentials** (for internal meetings):

Navigate to **Features** → **Embed** → **Meeting SDK** section to find:
- **SDK Key** (Client ID) — Use as `zoom_sdk_id`
- **SDK Secret** — Use as `zoom_sdk_pwd`

</Step>
</Steps>

## Using SDK Credentials

If your bots only join meetings within your own Zoom organization, pass SDK credentials when creating bots:

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'Python', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tab value="Bash">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY" \
         -d '{
               "meeting_url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
               "bot_name": "Recording Bot",
               "zoom_sdk_id": "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
               "zoom_sdk_pwd": "YOUR_SDK_SECRET"
             }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots",
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "x-meeting-baas-api-key": "YOUR-API-KEY",
        },
        json={
            "meeting_url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
            "bot_name": "Recording Bot",
            "zoom_sdk_id": "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
            "zoom_sdk_pwd": "YOUR_SDK_SECRET"
        }
    )
    print(response.json())
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch("https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-meeting-baas-api-key": "YOUR-API-KEY",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        meeting_url: "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
        bot_name: "Recording Bot",
        zoom_sdk_id: "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
        zoom_sdk_pwd: "YOUR_SDK_SECRET",
      }),
    });
    console.log(await response.json());
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
SDK credentials only work for meetings within your Zoom account. For external meetings, you need OBF tokens. See [OBF Token Support](/docs/api/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens).
</Callout>

## Advanced: ZAK Token URL

If you need the bot to join as a specific Zoom user (not just as an anonymous participant), you can provide a ZAK (Zoom Access Key) token via the `zoom_access_token_url` parameter.

```json
{
  "meeting_url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
  "bot_name": "Recording Bot",
  "zoom_access_token_url": "https://your-api.com/zoom/zak-token"
}
```

When the bot calls your endpoint, it appends `bot_uuid` and `extra` as query parameters (same as with OBF token URLs). This lets you identify which ZAK token to return:

```
GET https://your-api.com/zoom/zak-token?bot_uuid=abc-123&extra={"user_id":"usr_456"}
```

Your endpoint should return the raw ZAK token as plain text (not JSON).

<Callout>
ZAK tokens are different from OBF tokens. ZAK tokens let the bot join **as** a specific user. OBF tokens let the bot join **on behalf of** a user (as an assistant). For most recording use cases, OBF tokens are the right choice.
</Callout>

## Submitting for Marketplace Approval

Your app does not need to be listed on the Zoom Marketplace for Meeting BaaS to work. However, approval is required if:

- You want a public listing for users to discover your app
- You want the "approved" badge for trust
- You are using OAuth and want external users to authorize your app

### App Listing Section

Fill out the **App Listing** section:

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| Category | Choose the most relevant category (e.g., "Productivity") |
| Screenshots | At least 3 screenshots showing your app in action |
| Icon | 256x256 PNG with transparent background |
| Banner | 1280x640 PNG for the listing header |
| Support URL | Link to your support/help page |
| Privacy Policy URL | Link to your privacy policy |
| Terms of Use URL | Link to your terms of service |

### Technical Design Section

Zoom requires details about your app's architecture. Here is what to include:

**Technology Stack:**

You can keep this high-level. Example:

```
Frontend: React, TailwindCSS
Backend: Python/Node.js
Auth: OAuth 2.0 (your provider)
Database: PostgreSQL
Hosting: AWS/GCP/Azure
Zoom Integration: Zoom Meeting SDK via Meeting BaaS API
```

**Architecture Diagram:**

Include a simple diagram showing:
- Your application
- Meeting BaaS API
- Zoom SDK integration

This does not need to be complex. A basic flow diagram works.

### Application Development Section

| Question | Answer | Hint |
|----------|--------|------|
| Do you have a SSDLC? | **Yes** | Describe your secure development practices: code reviews, secrets management, dependency scanning, etc. Even informal practices count. |
| Does your app undergo SAST? | **Yes** (recommended) | Mention static analysis tools you use (CodeQL, Snyk, SonarQube, etc.). If you use GitHub, CodeQL is free and easy to set up. |
| Does your app undergo DAST? | **Optional** | Dynamic application security testing. Answer based on your practices. Not required for basic approval. |
| Third-party security testing? | **Optional** | Penetration testing or security audits. Not required but helps if you have them. |

<Callout>
**Small teams:** You do not need enterprise-grade security tooling. Basic practices like code reviews, dependency updates, and using a static analysis tool (even free ones like CodeQL) are sufficient for approval.
</Callout>

If you have security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001), upload them. They are not required but help with approval.

### Security Section

| Question | Answer | Hint |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does your app use TLS 1.2 or above? | **Yes** | Meeting BaaS uses TLS 1.2+. If you have your own backend, ensure it also uses TLS 1.2+. |
| Does your app use verification/secret tokens? | **No** (if Meeting BaaS only) | If you are only using this app with Meeting BaaS, select No. We do not use Zoom webhooks. If you have your own Zoom webhook integration, select Yes and describe your verification approach. |
| Does your app collect, store, or log user data? | **Depends** | If using Meeting BaaS only: We store meeting recordings and transcripts on your behalf. If you have additional data collection, describe it honestly. |

<Callout>
**Meeting BaaS users:** For most security questions, you can reference that your Zoom integration uses Meeting BaaS, which handles the SDK integration securely. You are responsible for your own application's security practices.
</Callout>

### Privacy Section

| Question | Answer | Hint |
|----------|--------|------|
| Does your app collect info from users under 16? | **No** | Unless your app specifically targets minors, answer No. Include age restrictions in your Terms of Service. |
| Is your app intended for education, healthcare, or government? | **Depends** | Answer based on your target market. If yes, you may need additional compliance documentation (FERPA, HIPAA, etc.). |
| Does your app share data with third parties? | **Depends** | If using Meeting BaaS: Yes, we use Meeting BaaS for recording infrastructure. Describe this in your privacy policy. |

Provide excerpts from your privacy policy covering:
- What data you collect
- How you use the data
- User data access rights
- How users can exercise those rights

<Callout>
**Privacy policy tip:** If you use Meeting BaaS, mention that recordings are processed by a third-party service (Meeting BaaS) and link to our privacy policy. Example: "Meeting recordings are processed by Meeting BaaS. See their privacy policy at meetingbaas.com/privacy."
</Callout>

### Submitting for Review

<Steps>
<Step>
### Verify Your Domain

Zoom requires domain verification. Follow the instructions in the **Domain Verification** section.

</Step>

<Step>
### Provide Test Credentials

Create a test account that Zoom reviewers can use to test your app. Include:
- Login credentials
- Any setup instructions
- Sample meeting URLs they can test with

</Step>

<Step>
### Submit

Click **Submit** to enter the review queue.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Review Process

**Usability Review:**
- A Zoom reviewer logs into your app using the test credentials
- They test the meeting recording/transcription flow
- If issues are found, you will receive a "more information required" request

**Security Review:**
- Zoom tests for common vulnerabilities
- They may use tools like Burp Suite to check for issues
- Ensure server-side validation for all sensitive operations

**Timeline:** Expect 1-2 weeks for review. You can request expedited review for urgent cases.

<Callout>
**Tip:** If you receive a "more information required" request, ask for a call. A 30-minute meeting with the reviewer often resolves issues faster than back-and-forth emails.
</Callout>

## Scopes Reference

| Scope | Purpose | When Needed |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `user:read:zak` | ZAK token access | Auto-added when you enable Meeting SDK. Required for the SDK to function. |
| `user:read:token` | OBF token access | Required for fetching OBF tokens. Add this for external meetings. |
| `user:read:user` | User profile information | Required for managed OAuth. We use this to get the `zoom_user_id` when creating connections. |

<Callout>
**For Meeting BaaS users:**
- **SDK credentials only:** No additional scopes needed beyond the auto-added `user:read:zak`
- **OBF tokens (managed OAuth):** Add both `user:read:token` and `user:read:user`
- **Existing Zoom app:** If you already have a Zoom app with other scopes, you can reuse it. Just enable Meeting SDK and add any missing scopes.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### SDK Authentication Failed

If you receive `ZOOM_SDK_AUTH_FAILED`:

1. Verify SDK Key and Secret are correct
2. Ensure Meeting SDK is enabled in your app
3. Check that your app is activated (not in draft status)
4. Confirm you are using the SDK credentials, not OAuth credentials

### OAuth Token Exchange Failed

If the authorization code exchange fails:

1. Verify the redirect URI matches exactly (including trailing slashes)
2. Check that the authorization code has not expired (~10 minutes)
3. Ensure all required scopes are added to your app
4. Verify Client ID and Secret are correct

### App Rejected During Review

Common rejection reasons:

- Missing or broken test credentials
- Privacy policy does not cover required topics
- Security vulnerabilities found (check for XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Screenshots do not match actual app functionality
