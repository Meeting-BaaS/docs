# Zoom Integration

Meeting BaaS supports Zoom through the Zoom Meeting SDK. This section covers everything you need to set up and configure Zoom bots.

<Callout type="warn">
**Important Deadline:** Starting March 2, 2026, Zoom requires OBF tokens for bots joining external meetings. See [OBF Token Support](/docs/api/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) for details.
</Callout>

## Two Approaches

How you integrate with Zoom depends on whose meetings your bots join:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Internal Meetings Only" href="/docs/api/getting-started/zoom/app-setup#using-sdk-credentials">
    Your bots join meetings within your own Zoom organization. Use SDK credentials to make all meetings "internal." No OBF tokens needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Meetings" href="/docs/api/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens">
    Your bots join meetings hosted by external accounts. OBF tokens are required after March 2, 2026.

## Key Concepts

### SDK Credentials vs OBF Tokens

**SDK credentials** (`zoom_sdk_id` and `zoom_sdk_pwd`) authenticate your Zoom app itself. When you use your own SDK credentials, meetings joined by your bots are considered "internal" to your Zoom account.

**OBF tokens** authenticate on behalf of a specific Zoom user. They are required when joining meetings hosted by accounts outside your organization.

### The March 2026 Deadline

Zoom is enforcing OBF tokens starting March 2, 2026. After this date:

- Bots joining external meetings without OBF tokens will fail
- Bots joining internal meetings (with SDK credentials) are unaffected
- Google Meet and Microsoft Teams bots are unaffected

### Authorized User Presence

When using OBF tokens, the Zoom user who authorized your app must be present in the meeting. If they leave, the bot disconnects. This is a Zoom platform requirement.

For continuous recording scenarios, Zoom is developing RTMS (Real-Time Media Streams) as an alternative. We are working on RTMS support.
