## Priority System

<Callout type="warning">
  Higher priority playbooks interrupt lower priority ones. The `failure_recovery` playbook (priority 100) will always take precedence.
</Callout>

```
100: failure_recovery
 50: calendar_sync_error
 11: onboarding_api_no_bot
 10: onboarding
  9: artifacts_reminder
  8: webhooks_adoption
  8: webhooks_polling
  7: calendar_expansion
  7: calendar_no_bots
  6: activation
  6: activation_bot_created
  5: winback_3d
  4: winback_7d
```

## Stop Conditions

All playbooks stop when:
- User **replies** to any growth email
- User **takes the suggested action** (creates bot, configures webhook, etc.)
- A **higher priority playbook** starts
- **Cooldown period** hasn't elapsed since last run
