**Hi {\{firstName\\}\},**

We detected heavy polling on GET /v2/bots/\{id\}. Webhooks eliminate this overhead entirely.

Polling Problems

Webhook Benefits

- Wastes compute — retry logic, interval timers
- Counts against rate limits (1000 req/min)
- Adds latency — you only learn at next poll
- Doesn't scale — N bots = N polling loops
- Remove your polling loop
