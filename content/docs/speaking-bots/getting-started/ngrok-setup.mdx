## Local Setup

For running one or more bots locally, you'll need an ngrok authtoken. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
2. After signing up, get your authtoken from the [Your Authtoken page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
3. Add the token to your `.env` file or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_auth_token_here
```

That's it folks :)

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Configuration modification">

We provide a ready-to-use configuration file in the repository at `config/ngrok/config.yml`. You can either use this file directly or create your own configuration.

The default location for the ngrok configuration file varies by operating system:

- Linux: `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml`

To verify your configuration file location, you can run:

```bash
ngrok config check
```

If you want to create or edit your own configuration file, here's what it should contain:

```yaml
version: '3'
agent:
  authtoken: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

tunnels:
  proxy1:
    proto: http
    addr: 8766
  proxy2:
    proto: http
    addr: 8768
```

For more detailed information about ngrok configuration options, see the [official ngrok configuration documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/config/).

## Usage

This sets up two separate tunnels (proxy1 and proxy2) that will be used by your bots to establish WebSocket connections with the meeting platforms. To start both tunnels simultaneously, run:

```bash
ngrok start --all --config config/ngrok/config.yml
```

The free tier of ngrok limits you to 2 concurrent tunnels, which means you can run up to 2 bots simultaneously in local development mode.

## WebSocket URL Resolution

When running the server in local development mode, it will automatically detect and use your ngrok URLs. The server determines the WebSocket URL to use in the following priority order:

1. User-provided URL in the request (if specified in the `websocket_url` field)
2. `BASE_URL` environment variable (recommended for production)
3. ngrok URL in local development mode
4. Auto-detection from request headers (fallback, not reliable in production)

To use local development mode with automatic ngrok detection:

```bash
# Start the API server with local development mode enabled
poetry run python run.py --local-dev
```

## Troubleshooting WebSocket Connections

### Common Issues

1. **Timing Issues with ngrok and Meeting Baas Bots**

   Sometimes, due to WebSocket connection delays through ngrok, the Meeting Baas bots may join the meeting before your local bot connects. If this happens:

   - Simply press `Enter` to respawn your bot
   - This will reinitiate the connection and allow your bot to join the meeting

2. **Connection failures**
   - Make sure ngrok is running with the correct configuration
   - Verify that you've entered the correct ngrok URLs when prompted
   - Check that your ngrok URLs are accessible (try opening in a browser)
   - Make sure you're using the `wss://` protocol with ngrok URLs

### Production Considerations

For production deployments, you should:

1. Set the `BASE_URL` environment variable to your server's public domain:
   ```
   export BASE_URL=https://your-server-domain.com
   ```
2. Ensure your server is accessible on the public internet
3. Consider using HTTPS/WSS for secure connections in production
