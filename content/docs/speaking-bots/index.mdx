# Speaking Bots

This repository demonstrates the capabilities of [MeetingBaas](https://meetingbaas.com) üêü's video meeting APIs by integrating with [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat)'s Python framework for building voice and multimodal conversational agents.

Our implementation creates AI meeting agents that can join and participate in Google Meet and Microsoft Teams meetings with distinct personalities and context defined in Markdown files.

This implementation extends [Pipecat's WebSocket server implementation](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/examples/websocket-server) to create:

- Meeting agents that can join Google Meet, Zoom or Microsoft Teams through the [MeetingBaas API](https://meetingbaas.com)
- Customizable personas with unique context
- Support for running multiple instances locally or at scale
