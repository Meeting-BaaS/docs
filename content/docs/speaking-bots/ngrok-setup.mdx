## Local Setup

For running multiple bots locally on macOS, you'll need to configure ngrok on your machine to allow each bot to have its own WebSocket connection through a unique tunnel.

## Configuration Steps

Create/edit the ngrok configuration file:

```bash
vim ~/Library/Application\ Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml
```

Add this configuration:

```yaml
version: "3"
agent:
  authtoken: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

tunnels:
  proxy1:
    proto: http
    addr: 8766
  proxy2:
    proto: http
    addr: 8768
```

## Usage

This sets up two separate tunnels (proxy1 and proxy2) that will be used by your bots to establish WebSocket connections with the meeting platforms.
