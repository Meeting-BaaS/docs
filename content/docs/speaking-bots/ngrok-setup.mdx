## Local Setup

For running multiple bots locally, you'll need to configure ngrok on your machine to allow each bot to have its own WebSocket connection through a unique tunnel.

## Configuration Steps

We provide a ready-to-use configuration file in the repository at `config/ngrok/config.yml`. You can either use this file directly or create your own configuration.

The default location for the ngrok configuration file varies by operating system:

- Linux: `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml`

To verify your configuration file location, you can run:

```bash
ngrok config check
```

If you want to create or edit your own configuration file, here's what it should contain:

```yaml
version: "3"
agent:
  authtoken: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

tunnels:
  proxy1:
    proto: http
    addr: 8766
  proxy2:
    proto: http
    addr: 8768
```

For more detailed information about ngrok configuration options, see the [official ngrok configuration documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/config/).

## Usage

This sets up two separate tunnels (proxy1 and proxy2) that will be used by your bots to establish WebSocket connections with the meeting platforms. To start both tunnels simultaneously, run:

```bash
ngrok start --all
```
