Meeting BaaS v2 generates various artifacts for each bot, including video recordings, audio files, transcriptions, and diarization data. All artifacts are stored securely and accessed via presigned URLs that are valid for 4 hours.

## Overview

When a bot completes recording a meeting, it generates several artifacts that you can access:

- **Video**: MP4 video recording (when video recording is enabled)
- **Audio**: FLAC audio recording (always generated)
- **Transcription**: Standardized transcription with accurate timestamps
- **Raw Transcription**: Provider-specific transcription with advanced features
- **Diarization**: Speaker identification and timing data

All artifacts are accessed via presigned URLs provided in bot details responses and webhook payloads.

## Video Artifact

The video artifact contains the complete video recording of the meeting.

**Format**: MP4 video file

**When Available**: Only when `recording_mode` is NOT `audio_only`

**Use Cases**:

- Providing users with raw video recording of meetings
- Video playback and review
- Integration with video analysis tools

## Artifact Access

All artifacts are accessed via presigned URLs that are valid for 4 hours from the time they are generated.

**Where to Find Artifacts**:

- `GET /v2/bots/{bot_id}` response - All artifact URLs in the response
- `bot.completed` webhook payload - All artifact URLs when bot completes
- Bot callbacks - Same URLs as webhook payloads

**Important Notes**:

- URLs expire after 4 hours - download artifacts promptly
- If `artifacts_deleted: true`, all artifact URLs will be `null`
- Artifacts are stored securely with data retention tags
- Download and store artifacts in your own storage for long-term access

## Data Retention and Security

With security built into every aspect of v2, data retention is as well. This approach severely limits data exposure by automatically removing artifacts after a specified retention period.

### Retention by Plan

Data retention periods vary by your API plan:

- **Pay-as-you-go**: 3 days
- **Pro**: 7 days
- **Scale**: 14 days
- **Enterprise**: 30 days

### Automatic Deletion

A background job automatically deletes artifacts that have exceeded the retention period based on your plan. This ensures data is not stored longer than necessary and minimizes security exposure.

### Manual Deletion

We recommend users take ownership of their data by using the `DELETE /v2/bots/{bot_id}/delete-data` endpoint to manually delete artifacts once they've been saved at your end.

**What Gets Deleted**:

- All artifacts from S3 (video, audio, transcription, diarization, screenshots)
- Optionally deletes transcription data from the transcription provider (default: `true`)
- Sets `artifacts_deleted: true` flag
- Ensures complete data scrubbing from our system

**Transcription Provider Deletion**: When using the delete endpoint with `delete_from_provider=true` (default), we also delete the transcription data from the transcription provider's servers (e.g., Gladia). This ensures complete data removal across all systems.

### Extended Retention

If you have a specific reason for needing data retained longer than your plan's default retention period, please [contact our support team](https://dashboard.meetingbaas.com/support-center) and we'll discuss how we can best support your needs.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Zoom

- JSONL diarization format
- User ID mapping in diarization data
- Multi-speaker support with channel-based audio

### Google Meet

- JSONL diarization format (same as Zoom)
- Network-based speaker detection for improved accuracy
- Diarization segments include `speaker`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `user_id` (assigned user ID)
- Single audio file processing
- **Diarization Accuracy**: 
  - Uses network-based detection which provides more accurate speaker identification
  - May have slight inaccuracies in timestamp alignment (typically less than 1 second)
  - Our system uses a statistical analysis approach to improve accuracy:
    - Matches transcription utterances to diarization segments using a ±1 second time window
    - Samples 30% of utterances (minimum 50, maximum 200 samples per speaker) for statistical significance
    - Uses frequency-based matching: the speaker with the highest match count within the time window is selected
    - Calculates confidence scores based on match frequency
    - This approach compensates for any timing discrepancies by finding the most likely speaker match statistically
  - For the most accurate timestamps, use the `transcription` artifact (output transcription) which applies timestamp offsets to account for chunk boundaries and provides accurate timing across the entire meeting

### Microsoft Teams

- JSONL diarization format (same as Zoom)
- UI-based speaker detection
- Diarization segments only include `speaker`, `start_time`, and `end_time` (no `user_id` or `lang`)
- Single audio file processing

## Best Practices

1. **Download Promptly**: Presigned URLs expire after 4 hours - download artifacts as soon as they're available
2. **Store Long-Term**: If you need artifacts long-term, download and store them in your own storage
3. **Use Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive artifact URLs automatically when bots complete
4. **Delete When Done**: Use the delete endpoint to remove data when you no longer need it
5. **Use Appropriate Artifacts**: Use `transcription` for display, `raw_transcription` for advanced features
6. **Track Transcription IDs**: For BYOK users, use `transcription_ids` to correlate with provider jobs

## Examples

### Accessing Artifacts from Bot Details

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": "completed",
    "video": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../video.mp4",

```json
{
  "event": "bot.completed",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "video": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../video.mp4",
    "audio": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../output.flac",
    "transcription": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../output_transcription.json",
    "raw_transcription": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../raw_transcription.json",
    "diarization": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../diarization.jsonl",
    "transcription_ids": ["gladia-job-12345"],
    "transcription_provider": "gladia"
  }
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How does Meeting BaaS create transcript chunks?">
    Meeting BaaS uses different chunking strategies depending on the meeting platform:

    **Zoom Bot:**

    - Creates **speaker-based chunks** in real-time as audio is received from the Zoom SDK
    - Each chunk is associated with a specific `user_id` (speaker)
    - Chunks are created automatically based on SDK audio events (approximately every 5-6 minutes per speaker)
    - Minimum chunk size: 100KB (smaller chunks are skipped)
    - Each chunk maintains speaker identity throughout, enabling perfect diarization

    **Google Meet/Teams Bot:**

    - Creates **time-based chunks** after the meeting recording is complete
    - The entire meeting audio is first recorded, then split into chunks using FFmpeg
    - Maximum chunk duration: 2 hours (7,200 seconds) per chunk
    - Chunks are created sequentially based on time intervals, not speaker identity
    - This approach allows processing of very long meetings while respecting transcription provider limits

    The chunking strategy ensures optimal transcription quality while managing file sizes and processing time efficiently.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are the diarization timestamps in the diarization file?">
    Diarization timestamp accuracy varies by platform:

    **Zoom:**

    - **Highly accurate** - Uses Zoom's native diarization with perfect speaker-to-user mapping
    - Timestamps are precise and directly tied to Zoom's audio stream
    - Each segment includes `user_id` for reliable speaker identification

    **Google Meet:**

    - Uses network-based speaker detection for improved accuracy
    - May have slight inaccuracies in timestamp alignment (typically less than 1 second)
    - See the [Google Meet section](#google-meet) above for detailed information about our statistical analysis approach

    **Microsoft Teams:**

    - **May have slight inaccuracies** - Uses UI-based speaker detection which can introduce latency
    - UI diarization relies on visual indicators (speaker highlighting) which may lag behind actual speech by 1-2 seconds

    For the most accurate timestamps, use the `transcription` artifact (output transcription) which applies timestamp offsets to account for chunk boundaries and provides accurate timing across the entire meeting.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Google Meet maintain consistent user_id across rejoins?">
    Google Meet uses a stable identifier system to assign `user_id` values that remain consistent even when participants rejoin:

    - **Identification Method**: Creates a unique hash based on the participant's profile picture URL (preferred) or full name
    - **Consistency**: The `user_id` will remain the same as long as:
      - The participant's profile picture URL doesn't change between rejoins (highly unlikely)
      - Or, if no profile picture is available, the participant's name remains unchanged
    - **Why This Works**: Profile picture URLs are unique per Google account and rarely change, making them a stable identifier. If a profile picture isn't available, the full name serves as a fallback identifier.

    This approach ensures that the same participant receives the same `user_id` throughout the meeting, even if they temporarily leave and rejoin, making it easier to track speaker continuity in your analysis.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long are signed URLs valid?">
  All artifact signed URLs are valid for **4 hours** from the time they are
  generated. After 4 hours, the URLs expire and you'll need to fetch new URLs
  from the bot details endpoint or webhook.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I don't download artifacts before they expire?">
  If a signed URL expires, you can retrieve new signed URLs by calling `GET
  /v2/bots/{bot_id}`. The endpoint will generate fresh signed URLs that are
  valid for another 4 hours. However, if the artifacts have been deleted (either
  manually or after the retention period), the URLs will return `null`.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between transcription and raw_transcription?">
    - **`transcription`** (output transcription): A standardized, processed transcription with accurate timestamps, real speaker names, and word-level timestamps. This is the recommended artifact for displaying transcripts to users.

    - **`raw_transcription`**: The complete, unmodified response from the transcription provider. Contains provider-specific features (summarization, LLM responses, translations, etc.) but timestamps may not be accurate due to chunking, and speaker IDs are numeric rather than names.

    Use `transcription` for display purposes and `raw_transcription` when you need access to provider-specific advanced features.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some artifact URLs null?">
    Artifact URLs can be `null` for several reasons:

    - **Video**: `null` when `recording_mode` is `audio_only` or if the artifact has been deleted
    - **Transcription/Raw Transcription**: `null` when transcription was not enabled or if artifacts have been deleted
    - **Diarization**: `null` when diarization data is not available or has been deleted
    - **All artifacts**: `null` when `artifacts_deleted: true` (data has been manually deleted or exceeded retention period)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know when artifacts are ready?">
    Artifacts are ready when the bot status is `completed`. You can:

    1. **Poll the bot details endpoint**: `GET /v2/bots/{bot_id}` - Check the `status` field
    2. **Use webhooks**: Set up a `bot.completed` webhook to receive artifact URLs automatically when the bot finishes
    3. **Check artifact URLs**: When `status: "completed"`, all available artifact URLs will be populated (non-null)

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I regenerate signed URLs after they expire?">
  Yes! Simply call `GET /v2/bots/{bot_id}` again to get fresh signed URLs. As
  long as the artifacts haven't been deleted, you'll receive new 4-hour valid
  URLs.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to artifacts after the retention period?">
    Artifacts are automatically deleted by a background job after your plan's retention period expires:

    - **Pay-as-you-go**: 3 days
    - **Pro**: 7 days
    - **Scale**: 14 days
    - **Enterprise**: 30 days

    After deletion, all artifact URLs will return `null` and `artifacts_deleted` will be `true`. We recommend downloading and storing artifacts in your own storage if you need long-term access.

  </Accordion>
