          Create a new Zoom credential for your team.

              Zoom credentials store your Zoom OAuth App credentials (client_id and client_secret) securely encrypted. You can create two types of credentials:

              **App-only credentials:** Provide only `name`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`. These credentials can be used for SDK authentication when bots join meetings.

              **User-authorized credentials:** Additionally provide `authorization_code` and `redirect_uri`. The API will exchange the authorization code for OAuth tokens, enabling OBF (On-Behalf-Of) token support. OBF tokens allow bots to join meetings on behalf of a specific Zoom user.

              **Security:** All credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Client secrets and OAuth tokens are never returned in API responses.

              **OAuth Flow:** To obtain an authorization code, redirect users to Zoom's OAuth authorization endpoint and capture the code from the callback. Ensure your redirect URI exactly matches the one registered in your Zoom OAuth App.

              **Error Scenarios:**
              - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input or missing redirect_uri when authorization_code is provided
              - `400 Bad Request`: Failed to exchange authorization code (invalid code or redirect_uri mismatch)
