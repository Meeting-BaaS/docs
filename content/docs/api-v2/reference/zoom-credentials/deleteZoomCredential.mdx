          Delete a Zoom credential (soft delete).

              The credential is marked as deleted and will no longer appear in list responses. Bots currently using this credential will fail to fetch OBF tokens.

              **Impact on Bots:** If bots are configured to use this credential (via `zoom_config.credential_id`), they will fail with an error when trying to fetch OBF tokens. Make sure to update any bot configurations before deleting a credential.

              **Soft Delete:** The credential is soft-deleted and can potentially be restored by support if needed. All associated encrypted data remains in the database.

              Returns 404 if the credential is not found or does not belong to your team.
