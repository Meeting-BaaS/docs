          List all Zoom credentials for your team.

              Returns all non-deleted credentials with their metadata. Sensitive fields (client_secret, OAuth tokens) are never included in responses.

              **Response Fields:**
              - `credential_id`: UUID to reference this credential in bot requests
              - `name`: User-friendly name for identification
              - `credential_type`: "app" (SDK only) or "user" (with OAuth tokens)
              - `zoom_user_id`: The Zoom user ID (only for "user" type)
              - `state`: "active" or "invalid"
              - `last_error_message`: Last OBF token fetch error (if any)

              **Error Tracking:** If bots fail to fetch OBF tokens using a credential, the error is recorded in `last_error_message` and `last_error_at`. These fields are cleared on successful OBF token fetch.
