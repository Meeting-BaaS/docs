          Update an existing Zoom credential.

              You can update the credential name, SDK credentials (client_id/client_secret), or re-authorize with new OAuth tokens.

              **Updating Name:** Provide only `name` to rename the credential.

              **Updating SDK Credentials:** Provide both `client_id` and `client_secret` together to update the SDK credentials.

              **Re-authorizing:** Provide `authorization_code`, `redirect_uri`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` to exchange a new authorization code for fresh OAuth tokens. This also resets the credential state to "active" and clears any error messages.

              **Error Scenarios:**
              - `400 Bad Request`: Missing redirect_uri when authorization_code is provided
              - `400 Bad Request`: Failed to exchange authorization code
              - `404 Not Found`: Credential not found or does not belong to your team
