          Update one or more calendar bots for a calendar.
              
              You can target a single event or all occurrences in a series using `series_id`, `all_occurrences`, and `event_id` in the request body. The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future.
              
              **Update Targets:**
              - `event_id`: Update bot for a specific event instance
              - `series_id`: Update bots for all occurrences of a series
              - `all_occurrences`: Update all future occurrences (for recurring events)
              
              **Updateable Fields:** You can update any bot configuration field (bot name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.). All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated.
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be updated. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
              
              **Partial Updates:** If updating multiple bots (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some bots may fail to update (e.g., if they're not in `scheduled` status). The response includes information about which bots were updated and which failed.
              
              Returns 200 with update results. Returns 404 if the event or calendar bot schedule is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow update.
