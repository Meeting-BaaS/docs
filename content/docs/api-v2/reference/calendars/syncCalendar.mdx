          Manually trigger a sync of calendar events.
              
              This will fetch all events from the calendar provider and update the calendar data. Events are normally synced automatically via push subscriptions, but you can use this endpoint to force a sync (e.g., after fixing connection errors or when you need immediate updates).
              
              **Sync Process:** The sync process fetches all events from the calendar provider. New events are added, updated events are modified, and cancelled events are marked as deleted. The sync may take a few minutes for calendars with many events.
              
              **Incremental vs Full Sync:** The endpoint performs a full sync, fetching all events from the calendar. Incremental syncs happen automatically via push subscriptions when events are created, updated, or cancelled.
              
              **Use Cases:**
              - Force a sync after fixing connection errors
              - Get immediate updates without waiting for push notifications
              - Recover from missed push notifications
              - Initial sync after creating a connection (though this happens automatically)
              
              **Response:** The response includes information about the sync operation, including how many events were synced. The actual event data is available via the list events endpoint.
              
              Returns 200 with sync results. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.
