          Retrieve detailed information about a specific calendar event.
              
              Returns comprehensive event information including attendees, meeting URL, meeting platform, status, and whether a bot is scheduled. Returns deleted events as well (use the `include_deleted` parameter or check the `deleted_at` field).
              
              **Event Details:** Includes all event metadata:
              - Title, description, location
              - Start and end times (ISO 8601 timestamps)
              - Status (confirmed, cancelled, tentative)
              - Attendees list
              - Meeting URL (if available)
              - Meeting platform (if detected from URL)
              - Whether it's an all-day event
              - Whether it's an exception to a recurring series
              
              **Bot Scheduling:** The `bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a calendar bot schedule exists for this event. If the event is part of a recurring series, the `series_bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a bot is scheduled for all occurrences.
              
              **Deleted Events:** Deleted events are included in the response. Check the `deleted_at` field to determine if an event has been deleted. Deleted events may still have associated bot schedules if they were scheduled before deletion.
              
              Returns 404 if the event is not found or does not belong to the specified calendar.
