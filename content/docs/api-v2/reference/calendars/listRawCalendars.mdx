          Preview available calendars from a Google or Microsoft account before
          creating a connection.
              
              Requires OAuth credentials (client ID, client secret, refresh token) to authenticate and list calendars. This endpoint does not create a connection - it only lists the calendars that are available for the given OAuth credentials. Useful for allowing users to select which calendars to sync.
              
              **OAuth Credentials:** You must provide valid OAuth credentials for the calendar provider. The endpoint will use the refresh token to obtain an access token and list calendars. If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the request will fail with 401 Unauthorized.
              
              **Calendar Information:** Returns a list of calendars with their IDs, names, descriptions, and whether they are primary calendars. Calendar IDs differ between providers (Google uses email-like IDs, Microsoft uses GUIDs).
              
              **Use Case:** This endpoint is typically called before creating a calendar connection to show users which calendars are available. Users can then select which calendars they want to sync.
              
              Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, or 403 if a Microsoft account license is required.
