          Update a calendar connection with new OAuth credentials.
              
              Useful when refresh tokens expire or credentials need to be rotated. The connection will be validated and a new push subscription will be created. The old subscription will be cancelled automatically.
              
              **OAuth Credentials:** You can update the client ID, client secret, and refresh token. All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated. The endpoint will validate the new credentials by attempting to refresh the access token.
              
              **Validation:** After updating credentials, the connection is validated by attempting to refresh the access token. If the refresh fails, the connection status is updated to `error` and the request may fail with 401 Unauthorized.
              
              **Subscription Renewal:** A new push subscription is created automatically after updating credentials. The old subscription is cancelled to prevent duplicate webhooks.
              
              **Use Cases:**
              - Refresh token expired and needs to be renewed
              - OAuth credentials rotated for security
              - Fixing connection errors by updating credentials
              
              Returns 200 with the updated calendar connection. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 403 if permission is denied, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.
