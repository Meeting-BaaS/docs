          Retrieve a paginated list of calendar connections.
              
              Supports filtering by calendar platform (google, microsoft) and connection status (active, error, revoked, permission_denied). Results are ordered by creation date (newest first). Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation.
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 20, max: 100).
              
              **Filtering:**
              - `platform`: Filter by calendar platform (google, microsoft)
              - `status`: Filter by connection status (active, error, revoked, permission_denied)
              
              **Connection Status:**
              - `active`: Connection is working and syncing events
              - `error`: Connection has errors (OAuth token refresh failed, etc.)
              - `revoked`: OAuth access was revoked by the user
              - `permission_denied`: Insufficient permissions for the OAuth scopes
              
              Returns a paginated list of calendar connections with metadata including calendar ID, platform, account email, status, and last sync time.
