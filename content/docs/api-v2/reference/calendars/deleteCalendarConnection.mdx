              This will stop syncing events and remove all associated calendar data (events, event instances, series). The push subscription will be cancelled automatically. This operation is irreversible.
              
              **Data Deletion:** All calendar data associated with this connection will be deleted:
              - Event series and instances
              - Calendar bot schedules
              - Sync history
              
              **Subscription Cancellation:** The push subscription is cancelled automatically when the connection is deleted. You will no longer receive webhooks for this calendar.
              
              **Irreversible Operation:** Once a calendar connection is deleted, it cannot be recovered. All associated data is permanently removed. If you need to reconnect the calendar, you must create a new connection.
              
              **Bot Schedules:** If there are active calendar bot schedules for events in this calendar, they will be cancelled when the connection is deleted. Bots that have already joined meetings will continue to function normally.
              
              Returns 200 with confirmation of deletion. Returns 404 if the calendar connection is not found or does not belong to your team.
