          Cancel one or more scheduled calendar bots.
              
              You can target a single event or all occurrences in a series using `series_id`, `all_occurrences`, and `event_id` in the request body. Bots must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future.
              
              **Cancellation Targets:**
              - `event_id`: Cancel bot for a specific event instance
              - `series_id`: Cancel bots for all occurrences of a series
              - `all_occurrences`: Cancel all future occurrences (for recurring events)
              
              **Status Requirements:** Bots must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be cancelled via this endpoint. If a bot is in an invalid state, that bot will fail to cancel, but other bots may still be cancelled.
              
              **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
              
              **Partial Cancellation:** If cancelling multiple bots (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some bots may fail to cancel (e.g., if they're not in `scheduled` status). The response includes information about which bots were cancelled and which failed.
              
              **Irreversible Operation:** Once a calendar bot is cancelled, it cannot be recovered. If you need to cancel a bot that is about to join, you should use the leave endpoint on the actual bot instance instead.
              
              **No Token Impact:** Since tokens are not reserved for calendar bots, cancelling a bot does not affect your token balance.
              
              Returns 200 with cancellation results. Returns 404 if the event or calendar bot schedule is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow deletion.
