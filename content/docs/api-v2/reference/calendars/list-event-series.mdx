          Retrieve a paginated list of event series (both one-off and recurring
          events).
              
              Each series includes its associated event instances. Supports filtering by event type (one_off, recurring) and whether series are deleted. Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation.
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 50, max: 250).
              
              **Event Types:**
              - `one_off`: Single events (not part of a recurring series)
              - `recurring`: Events that are part of a recurring series
              
              **Series Information:** Each series includes its series ID, event type, whether a bot is scheduled for all occurrences (`series_bot_scheduled`), and an array of event instances. For one-off events, the instances array contains a single instance. For recurring events, it contains all instances that have been synced.
              
              **Filtering:**
              - `event_type`: Filter by event type (one_off, recurring)
              - `include_deleted`: Include deleted series in results (default: false)
              
              **Bot Scheduling:** The `series_bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a calendar bot schedule exists for all occurrences of this series. Individual instances may have different bot scheduling status.
              
              Returns a paginated list of event series with their instances.
