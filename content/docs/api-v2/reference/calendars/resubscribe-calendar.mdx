          Renew or recreate the push subscription for a calendar connection.
              
              Useful when subscriptions expire or need to be refreshed. A new subscription will be created and the old one will be cancelled. Subscriptions expire after a certain period (3 days for Microsoft, longer for Google) and need to be renewed periodically.
              
              **Subscription Renewal:** The endpoint creates a new push subscription with the calendar provider. The old subscription is cancelled to prevent duplicate webhooks. The new subscription will send webhooks for all calendar events (created, updated, cancelled).
              
              **Subscription Expiration:** Subscriptions expire automatically after a certain period:
              - Microsoft: 3 days maximum
              - Google: Longer period (varies)
              
              When a subscription expires, you will stop receiving webhook notifications. Use this endpoint to renew the subscription before it expires.
              
              **Use Cases:**
              - Subscription is about to expire
              - Subscription has expired and webhooks stopped working
              - Need to refresh subscription for troubleshooting
              
              **Response:** The response includes information about the new subscription, including when it was created and when it expires.
              
              Returns 200 with subscription information. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 403 if permission is denied, or 404 if the calendar connection is not found.
