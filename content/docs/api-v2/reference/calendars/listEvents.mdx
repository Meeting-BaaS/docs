          Retrieve a paginated list of calendar events.
              
              Supports filtering by date range, status (confirmed, cancelled, tentative), and whether events are deleted. Results include whether a bot is scheduled for each event. Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation.
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 50, max: 250).
              
              **Filtering:**
              - `start_after`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return events starting after this time
              - `start_before`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return events starting before this time
              - `status`: Filter by event status (confirmed, cancelled, tentative)
              - `include_deleted`: Include deleted events in results (default: false)
              
              **Event Information:** Each event includes its ID, title, start/end times, status, meeting URL (if available), meeting platform (if detected), and whether a bot is scheduled for the event.
              
              **Bot Scheduling:** The `bot_scheduled` field indicates whether a calendar bot schedule exists for this event. This does not mean the bot has joined - it means a bot is scheduled to join when the event starts.
              
              Returns a paginated list of calendar events with metadata.
