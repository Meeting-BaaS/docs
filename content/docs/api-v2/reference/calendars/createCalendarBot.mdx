          Schedule a bot to automatically join a calendar event.
              
              You can schedule for all occurrences of a recurring event or specific event instances. The bot will use the meeting URL from the event. Returns partial success if some events fail to schedule (e.g., if a bot is already scheduled or if the event doesn't have a meeting URL).
              
              **Scheduling Options:**
              - `series_id`: Schedule for all occurrences of a recurring series
              - `event_id`: Schedule for a specific event instance
              - `all_occurrences`: Schedule for all future occurrences (for recurring events)
              
              **Meeting URL Requirement:** The event must have a meeting URL. If the event doesn't have a meeting URL, the scheduling will fail for that event. The meeting platform is automatically detected from the URL.
              
              **Bot Configuration:** You can provide bot configuration (name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.) that will be used for all scheduled bots. The configuration applies to all events you're scheduling for.
              
              **Partial Success:** If you're scheduling for multiple events (e.g., all occurrences of a series), some events may fail to schedule (e.g., if a bot is already scheduled). The response includes information about which events succeeded and which failed.
              
              **Token Reservation:** Tokens are NOT reserved at scheduling time. Token availability and daily bot cap are checked when each bot actually joins the meeting. If tokens are insufficient or the daily cap is reached at join time, the bot will fail with an appropriate error.
              
              **Status:** The calendar bot schedule starts in `scheduled` status and transitions to `completed` when the bot instance is created and queued to join. If the bot fails to join, it transitions to `failed` status.
              
              Returns 201 with scheduling results. Returns 404 if the event series or event is not found.
