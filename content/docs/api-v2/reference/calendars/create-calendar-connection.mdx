          Connect a Google or Microsoft calendar to your account.
              
              The connection will automatically sync events and create push subscriptions for real-time updates. You must provide your own OAuth credentials (client ID, secret, refresh token). Once connected, the calendar will be synced immediately, and webhook subscriptions will be created for real-time event updates.
              
              **OAuth Credentials:** You must provide valid OAuth credentials for the calendar provider. The endpoint will validate the credentials by attempting to refresh the access token. If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the request will fail with 401 Unauthorized.
              
              **Initial Sync:** After creating the connection, an initial sync is performed automatically. This fetches all events from the calendar provider. The sync may take a few minutes for calendars with many events.
              
              **Push Subscriptions:** A push subscription is created automatically for real-time event updates. The subscription will send webhooks when events are created, updated, or cancelled.
              
              **Calendar Limits:** There may be limits on the number of calendar connections per team. If the limit is exceeded, the request will fail with 429 Status Code.
              
              **Duplicate Connections:** If a connection already exists for the same calendar ID and team, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. You can update an existing connection using the PATCH endpoint instead.
              
              Returns 201 with the newly created calendar connection. Returns 401 if OAuth token refresh failed, 429 if the calendar connection limit is exceeded, or 409 if the connection already exists.
