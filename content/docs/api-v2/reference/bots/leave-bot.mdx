          Instruct a bot to leave the meeting immediately.
              
              The bot will stop recording and processing, then exit the meeting. Only works if the bot is currently in the meeting (status is `in_call_recording` or `transcribing`). The bot will send a final webhook event when it leaves.
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in a state that allows leaving. Bots that have already completed, failed, or are not yet in the meeting cannot be left via this endpoint. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Token Consumption:** When a bot is manually left, tokens are consumed based on the duration from when recording started to when the bot left. The bot will transition to `completed` status and send a completion webhook.
              
              **Immediate Effect:** The leave command is sent to the bot process immediately. The bot will stop recording and exit the meeting as soon as it receives the command (usually within a few seconds).
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation.
