          Permanently delete all bot data including recordings, transcripts,
          summaries, and screenshots.
              
              This operation is irreversible. All artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization, screenshots) will be permanently deleted. Optionally delete transcription data from the transcription provider as well using the `delete_transcription` query parameter.
              
              **Data Deletion:** 
              - All artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization, screenshots) are permanently deleted
              - The `artifacts_deleted` field is set to `true`
              - Artifact URLs will return `null` in subsequent API calls
              - Bot metadata remains accessible but all associated data is removed
              
              **Transcription Provider Deletion:** If `delete_transcription=true` is provided, the transcription data will also be deleted from the transcription provider (e.g., Gladia). This requires the bot to have transcription enabled and a transcription provider configured. If the bot uses BYOK transcription, you must have access to the transcription provider API key.
              
              **Irreversible Operation:** Once data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have downloaded or backed up any data you need before calling this endpoint.
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `completed` or `failed` status. Bots that are still in progress (queued, joining, in_call_recording, transcribing) cannot have their data deleted. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation.
