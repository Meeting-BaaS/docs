          Retrieve a paginated list of scheduled bots.
              
              Supports filtering by status (`scheduled`, `completed`, `failed`) and date range. Results are ordered by scheduled join time (earliest first). Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation.
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 20, max: 100).
              
              **Filtering:**
              - `status`: Filter by scheduled bot status (comma-separated for multiple statuses)
              - `scheduled_after`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots scheduled to join after this time
              - `scheduled_before`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots scheduled to join before this time
              
              **Status Values:**
              - `scheduled`: Bot is scheduled but has not yet joined
              - `completed`: Bot instance was created and queued to join (bot may still be joining)
              - `failed`: Bot failed to join (token issues, daily cap, etc.)
              
              Returns a paginated list of scheduled bots with metadata including bot ID, scheduled join time, status, and basic configuration.
