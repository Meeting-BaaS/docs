          Create multiple scheduled bots in a single request with partial
          success support.
              
              Processes each scheduled bot creation request sequentially. Each item is validated and processed independently. Token reservation and daily bot cap checks are NOT performed at creation time - they are performed when each bot actually joins the meeting.
              
              **Processing Order:** Items are processed in the order they appear in the request array. Each item goes through validation: platform detection, BYOK transcription check, and join time validation. Unlike immediate bot creation, daily bot cap and token availability are not checked at creation time.
              
              **Partial Success:** The response always has `success: true`, even if all items fail. Check the `errors` array to identify failed items. The `data` array contains successfully scheduled bots with their `bot_id` and preserved `extra` metadata.
              
              **Join Time Validation:** Each scheduled bot's `join_at` time must be in the future (at least 1 minute ahead). If a join time is invalid, that item will fail with a validation error, but other items will continue processing.
              
              **Error Scenarios:** 
              - Validation errors: Invalid join time, invalid meeting URL, invalid configuration
              - Platform detection failures: `INVALID_MEETING_PLATFORM`
              - BYOK not enabled: `BYOK_TRANSCRIPTION_NOT_ENABLED_ON_PLAN`
              - System failures: `BOT_CREATE_FAILED`
              
              **Note:** Daily bot cap and token availability are checked when each bot joins, not at creation time. If these checks fail at join time, the bot will transition to `failed` status and send a failure webhook.
              
              Returns 201 with partial success response. All items may succeed, all may fail, or any combination.
