          Create multiple bots in a single request with partial success support.
              
              Processes each bot creation request sequentially (index 0, 1, 2...). Each item is validated and processed independently. If some bots fail to create, the request still returns 201 with a `data` array containing successful creations and an `errors` array containing failures. Each error includes the `index` of the failed item in the original request array.
              
              **Processing Order:** Items are processed in the order they appear in the request array. Each item goes through the same validation and checks as a single bot creation: platform detection, BYOK transcription check, daily bot cap check, token availability check, and deduplication lock acquisition.
              
              **Partial Success:** The response always has `success: true`, even if all items fail. Check the `errors` array to identify failed items. The `data` array contains successfully created bots with their `bot_id` and preserved `extra` metadata. The `errors` array contains failed items with `index`, `code`, `message`, `details`, and preserved `extra` metadata.
              
              **Daily Bot Cap:** The daily bot cap is checked per item, not per batch. If the cap is reached mid-batch, subsequent items will fail with `DAILY_BOT_CAP_REACHED` error. The cap is based on bots created in the last 24 hours.
              
              **Token Reservation:** Tokens are reserved individually for each successful bot creation (0.5 tokens per bot). If token availability becomes insufficient mid-batch, subsequent items will fail with `INSUFFICIENT_TOKENS`.
              
              **Error Index Mapping:** Each error includes an `index` field (0-based) that corresponds to the item's position in the request array. Use this to correlate errors with your original request. Validation errors include detailed validation issues in the `details` field.
              
              **Error Isolation:** Each bot creation is processed independently. If one bot creation fails, it does not affect other bots in the batch. Failed items are included in the `errors` array while successful items are in the `data` array.
              
              Returns 201 with partial success response. All items may succeed, all may fail, or any combination. Always check both `data` and `errors` arrays.
