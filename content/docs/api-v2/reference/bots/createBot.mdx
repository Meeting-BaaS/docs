              The bot will automatically join the meeting, request recording permissions, and start recording once accepted. You can provide a bot-specific callback URL to receive bot.completed and bot.failed events for this bot (in addition to your account's webhooks). The bot will send webhook events for status changes, completion, and failures.
              
              Returns a `bot_id` (UUID) that you can use to track status, retrieve meeting data, and manage the bot. The bot will be queued immediately and join the meeting as soon as possible (may take up to 2 minutes depending on availability of bot slots).
              
              **Token Reservation:** 0.5 tokens are reserved immediately upon creation. These tokens will be consumed based on the bot's duration and outcome. If the bot fails due to user-responsible errors (`BOT_NOT_ACCEPTED`, `TIMEOUT_WAITING_TO_START`), recording tokens will be charged based on the time spent in the waiting room.
              
              **Deduplication:** By default, multiple bots can join the same meeting URL. Set `allow_multiple_bots: false` to prevent duplicate bots within 5 minutes. The deduplication check expires after 5 minutes, allowing a new bot to join the same meeting URL after that period.
              
              **Rate Limits:** Subject to your API key's rate limits and your team's daily bot cap. The daily bot cap is checked before token reservation. If the cap is reached, the request will fail with a 429 status code.
              
              **Error Scenarios:**
              - `402 Payment Required`: Insufficient tokens available
              - `409 Conflict`: Bot already exists for the same meeting URL (when `allow_multiple_bots` is false)
              - `429 Too Many Requests`: Daily bot cap reached or rate limit exceeded
