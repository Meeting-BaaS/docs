          Resend the final webhook (completed or failed) for a bot.
              
              Useful if the webhook delivery failed or you need to reprocess the webhook event. The webhook will be sent to all configured webhook endpoints for your account.
              
              **Webhook Delivery:** The webhook will be sent to all configured webhook endpoints for your account. The webhook payload will be identical to the original final webhook (either `bot.completed` or `bot.failed` event).
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `completed` or `failed` status. Bots that are still in progress cannot have their final webhook resent. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Use Cases:** 
              - Webhook delivery failed due to network issues
              - Webhook endpoint was temporarily unavailable
              - Need to reprocess a webhook event
              - Testing webhook integration
              
              **Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent. You can call it multiple times, and it will resend the webhook each time. There is no limit on how many times you can resend a webhook.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation.
