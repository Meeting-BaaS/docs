          Cancel and delete a scheduled bot.
              
              The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing. Once deleted, the scheduled bot cannot be recovered.
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be deleted via this endpoint. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Join Time Requirements:** The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict. This ensures the bot can be cancelled before it starts processing.
              
              **Irreversible Operation:** Once a scheduled bot is deleted, it cannot be recovered. If you need to cancel a bot that is about to join, you should use the leave endpoint on the actual bot instance instead.
              
              **No Token Impact:** Since tokens are not reserved for scheduled bots, deleting a scheduled bot does not affect your token balance.
              
              Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow deletion or the join time is too close.
