          Retrieve a paginated list of screenshot URLs captured during the
          meeting.
              
              Screenshots are taken periodically during the meeting and can be used to visualize meeting content. Each screenshot is a presigned URL valid for 4 hours.
              
              **Screenshot Availability:** 
              - Screenshots are only available for Google Meet and Microsoft Teams bots
              - Screenshots are only available for bots with `recording_mode` set to `speaker_view` or `gallery_view`
              - Audio-only recordings do not have screenshots
              - Screenshots are captured at regular intervals during the meeting
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The `limit` parameter controls how many screenshots are returned per page (default: 50, max: 100).
              
              **URL Expiration:** All screenshot URLs are presigned URLs that expire after 4 hours. If the bot's data has been deleted, this endpoint will return an empty list.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.
