          Retry sending the transcription callback for a bot.
              
              You can override the callback configuration (URL, method, secret) if needed. Only works for bots that have completed or failed. The callback will be sent to the provided URL (or the bot's original callback URL if not overridden).
              
              **Callback Configuration:** You can override the callback URL, HTTP method (POST or PUT), and secret in the request body. If not provided, the bot's original callback configuration will be used. The secret will be included in the `x-mb-secret` header for validation.
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `completed` or `failed` status and must have had transcription enabled. Bots without transcription or bots that are still in progress cannot have their callback retried. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Callback Payload:** The callback payload will be identical to the original callback (either `bot.completed` or `bot.failed` event with transcription data). The payload format matches the webhook format.
              
              **Use Cases:**
              - Callback delivery failed due to network issues
              - Callback endpoint was temporarily unavailable
              - Need to send callback to a different endpoint
              - Testing callback integration
              
              **Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent. You can call it multiple times with the same or different configurations.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow this operation or if no callback was configured.
