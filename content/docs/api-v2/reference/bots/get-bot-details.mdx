          Get comprehensive information about a specific bot.
              
              Returns detailed bot information including current status, configuration, meeting metadata, and presigned URLs for all artifacts (video, audio, transcription, diarization). Artifact URLs are valid for 4 hours from the time of request. Returns `null` for artifacts if the bot's data has been deleted.
              
              **Artifact URLs:** All artifact URLs (video, audio, transcription, diarization) are presigned URLs that expire after 4 hours. If the bot's data has been deleted (via the delete-data endpoint or data retention policy), these fields will be `null`. The `artifacts_deleted` field indicates whether the bot's data has been permanently removed.
              
              **Status Information:** The response includes the bot's current status (`status` field) and timestamps for key events (joined_at, exited_at, created_at). If the bot failed, the response includes `error_code` and `error_message` fields with details about what went wrong.
              
              **Meeting Metadata:** Includes meeting platform, meeting URL, participants list, speakers list, and meeting duration (if available). Some metadata may be `null` if the bot failed before joining or if the information is not available.
              
              **Transcription Information:** If transcription was enabled, the response includes transcription provider, transcription IDs (for BYOK providers), and URLs to raw and processed transcription files.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.
