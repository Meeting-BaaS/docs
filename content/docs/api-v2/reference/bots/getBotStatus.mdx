          Get the current status of a bot, including the latest status code,
          transcription status, and timestamp.
              
              Useful for polling bot state without fetching the full bot details. Returns lightweight status information including the current status code, transcription status, and when the status was last updated (`updated_at`).
              
              **Response Fields:**
              - `bot_id`: The UUID of the bot
              - `status`: The current bot status (queued, joining, in_call_recording, transcribing, completed, failed)
              - `transcription_status`: The current transcription status (not-applicable, not-started, queued, processing, done, error)
              - `updated_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the status was last updated
              
              **Transcription Status:** The transcription status is fetched in real-time from the transcription provider (e.g., Gladia) if transcription is enabled. This allows you to track transcription progress separately from the bot's overall status.
              
              **Polling Considerations:** 
              - **Not Recommended for Active Monitoring:** Due to the nature of meetings running for extended periods (often hours), frequent polling is not recommended. Instead, use `callback_config` when creating bots or configure webhooks at the account level to receive real-time status updates.
              - **Reconciliation Use Case:** This endpoint is better suited for reconciliation purposes (e.g., checking bot status after a webhook delivery failure or verifying final state).
              - **If Polling is Necessary:** If you must poll, use a judicious interval (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) and implement exponential backoff to avoid rate limits. Consider the meeting duration when determining polling frequency.
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.
