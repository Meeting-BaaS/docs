          Update bot configuration (currently only supports updating the extra
          parameter).
              
              Allows updating the `extra` metadata even while the bot is running. The updated extra will be reflected in subsequent webhooks and API responses. This is useful when your system evolves and you need to attach additional tracking information to a bot after it has started.
              
              **Merge Behavior:** The `extra` parameter performs a shallow merge with the existing extra object:
              - New keys are added to the existing extra object
              - Existing keys are overwritten with new values
              - Keys not included in the update request remain unchanged
              - Pass `null` to clear all extra data
              
              **Example Merge:**
              - Current extra: `{ "customer_id": "123", "session_id": "abc" }`
              - Update with: `{ "session_id": "xyz", "order_id": "456" }`
              - Result: `{ "customer_id": "123", "session_id": "xyz", "order_id": "456" }`
              
              **Webhook Behavior:** After updating extra, all future webhooks (including status updates) will use the new value from the database. The updated extra is fetched in real-time for each webhook, ensuring consistency.
              
              **Works for Any Bot Status:** You can update extra for bots in any status (queued, recording, completed, failed). This allows you to add correlation metadata even after a bot has finished.
              
              **Use Cases:**
              - Add tracking IDs after bot creation
              - Update correlation metadata when your system state changes
              - Fix incorrect tracking information
              - Add additional context for completed bots
              
              Returns 404 if the bot is not found or does not belong to your team.
