          Retrieve detailed information about a specific scheduled bot.
              
              Returns the scheduled bot's configuration, scheduled join time, current status, and associated bot instance (if the bot has already joined). Includes all the same configuration options as immediate bot creation.
              
              **Status Information:** The response includes the scheduled bot's current status (`scheduled`, `completed`, or `failed`) and when the status was last updated. If the bot has joined, the response includes a link to the actual bot instance.
              
              **Scheduled Join Time:** The `join_at` field contains the ISO 8601 timestamp when the bot is scheduled to join the meeting.
              
              **Bot Instance:** If the scheduled bot has transitioned to `completed` status, the bot instance has been created and is queued to join. You can use the `bot_id` (which will be reused as the bot's UUID when it joins) to query the bot's status and retrieve meeting data once it has joined.
              
              **Updates and Deletions:** If the bot is in `scheduled` status and the join time is at least 4 minutes in the future, you can update or delete the scheduled bot. This ensures the bot can be modified before it starts processing.
              
              Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found or does not belong to your team.
