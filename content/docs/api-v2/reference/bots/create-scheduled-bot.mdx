          Schedule a bot to join a meeting at a specific time in the future.
              
              The bot will automatically join the meeting at the specified `join_at` time (ISO 8601 timestamp). You can provide a callback URL to receive events for this bot. The bot configuration is stored immediately, but token reservation and daily bot cap checks are performed when the bot actually joins the meeting.
              
              **Scheduling:** The `join_at` timestamp must be in the future (at least 1 minute ahead). The bot will automatically attempt to join the meeting at the specified time. There may be a small processing delay (typically less than a minute).
              
              **Token Reservation:** Tokens are NOT reserved at creation time. Token availability and daily bot cap are checked when the bot actually joins the meeting. If tokens are insufficient or the daily cap is reached at join time, the bot will fail with an appropriate error and transition to `failed` status.
              
              **Deduplication:** Deduplication is checked when the bot joins, not at creation time. This means you can schedule multiple bots for the same meeting URL, but only one will successfully join (unless `allow_multiple_bots` is true).
              
              **Status:** The scheduled bot starts in `scheduled` status and transitions to `completed` when the bot instance is created and queued to join. If the bot fails to join, it transitions to `failed` status.
              
              **Updates and Deletions:** Scheduled bots can be updated or deleted as long as they are in `scheduled` status and the join time is at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be modified before it starts processing.
              
              Returns a `bot_id` (UUID) that you can use to track and manage the scheduled bot. This UUID will be reused as the bot's UUID when it actually joins.
