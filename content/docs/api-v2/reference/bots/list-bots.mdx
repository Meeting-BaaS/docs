          List all bots for your team with pagination support.
              
              Filter by status (queued, joining, in_call_recording, transcribing, completed, failed), meeting platform (zoom, meet, teams), and date range. Results are ordered by creation date (newest first). Use cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation through large result sets.
              
              **Pagination:** Uses cursor-based pagination. Provide a `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. The response includes a `next_cursor` if more results are available. The `limit` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (default: 50, max: 250).
              
              **Filtering:** 
              - `status`: Filter by bot status (comma-separated for multiple statuses)
              - `platform`: Filter by meeting platform (zoom, meet, teams)
              - `created_after`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots created after this time
              - `created_before`: ISO 8601 timestamp - only return bots created before this time
              
              **Date Range:** The `created_after` and `created_before` filters use ISO 8601 timestamps. Results are limited to bots created within the last 90 days by default.
              
              Returns a paginated list of bots with metadata including bot ID, status, meeting platform, creation time, and basic configuration.
