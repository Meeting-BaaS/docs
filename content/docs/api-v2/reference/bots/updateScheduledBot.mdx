          Update a scheduled bot's configuration or scheduled join time.
              
              The bot must be in `scheduled` status and the join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future. This ensures the bot can be updated before it starts processing.
              
              **Updateable Fields:** You can update any configuration field (bot name, image, recording mode, transcription settings, etc.) and the scheduled join time (`join_at`). All fields are optional - only provided fields will be updated.
              
              **Join Time Requirements:** 
              - The new `join_at` time must be in the future
              - The bot must be in `scheduled` status
              - The join time must be at least 4 minutes in the future (lock window)
              - If the join time is too close, the request will fail with 409 Conflict
              
              **Status Requirements:** The bot must be in `scheduled` status. Bots that have already joined (`completed`) or failed (`failed`) cannot be updated. If the bot is in an invalid state, the request will fail with a 409 Conflict status.
              
              **Validation:** All updated fields are validated using the same rules as bot creation. Invalid configurations will result in a 400 Bad Request error.
              
              Returns 404 if the scheduled bot is not found, or 409 if the bot's status does not allow update or the join time is too close.
