Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about bot and calendar events. Instead of polling the API, you can configure webhook endpoints that will receive HTTP POST requests when events occur.

## Overview

Meeting BaaS v2 uses [SVIX](https://www.svix.com/) for webhook delivery, ensuring reliable delivery with retries and delivery status tracking.

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are configured at the account level. You can set up webhook endpoints in your account settings to receive notifications for all bot and calendar events.

## Callbacks vs Webhooks

Meeting BaaS v2 supports two notification mechanisms:

1. **Webhooks** (Account-level): Configured in your account settings, sent via SVIX. All events for all bots are sent to your configured webhook endpoints.

2. **Callbacks** (Bot-specific): Configured per-bot when creating a bot using the `callback_config` parameter. Callbacks are direct HTTP requests (POST or PUT) sent to your specified URL when that specific bot completes or fails.

**Key Differences:**

- **Webhooks**: Account-level, sent via SVIX with signature verification, all events
- **Callbacks**: Bot-specific, direct HTTP requests, only for bot completion/failure events

You can use both webhooks and callbacks together - they serve different purposes and complement each other.

## Webhook Security

All webhooks are signed using SVIX's signature verification. The signature is included in the `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, and `svix-signature` headers.

To verify webhooks, use SVIX's verification libraries or verify the signature manually using your webhook signing secret.

## Bot Webhooks

### `bot.status_change`

Triggered whenever a bot's status changes (e.g., from `queued` to `joining`, from `joining` to `in_call_recording`, etc.).

**Use Cases:**

- Track bot progress in real-time
- Update UI to show current bot state
- Trigger actions based on status changes
- Monitor bot lifecycle

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "bot.status_change",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "event_id": "789e0123-e45b-67c8-d901-234567890abc",
    "status": {
      "code": "in_call_recording",
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",

    },
    "extra": {
      "customer_id": "12345"
    }
  }
}
```

**Status Codes:**

- `queued`: Bot is queued and waiting to join
- `joining`: Bot is attempting to join the meeting
- `in_call_recording`: Bot is in the meeting and recording
- `transcribing`: Bot has exited and transcription is in progress
- `completed`: Bot has completed successfully
- `failed`: Bot has failed

### `bot.completed`

Triggered when a bot successfully completes recording and processing.

**Use Cases:**

- Download meeting recordings automatically
- Process transcriptions
- Trigger post-meeting workflows
- Update meeting records in your system

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "bot.completed",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "event_id": "789e0123-e45b-67c8-d901-234567890abc",
    "transcription": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../transcription.json",
    "mp4": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../video.mp4",

## Webhook Delivery

- **Retries**: SVIX automatically retries failed webhook deliveries
- **Timeout**: Webhook endpoints should respond within 30 seconds
- **Idempotency**: Webhooks may be delivered multiple times - ensure your handler is idempotent
- **Ordering**: Webhooks are delivered in order, but network issues may cause out-of-order delivery

## Testing Webhooks

You can test your webhook endpoint using tools like:

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local development
- [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or [webhook.cool](https://webhook.cool) for testing
- [SVIX CLI](https://www.svix.com/docs/cli/) for local testing

## Callbacks

Callbacks are bot-specific HTTP requests sent directly to a URL you provide when creating a bot. Unlike webhooks (which are account-level and sent via SVIX), callbacks are:

- **Bot-specific**: Configured per-bot using `callback_config` when creating a bot
- **Direct HTTP**: Sent directly to your URL (not via SVIX)
- **Limited events**: Only sent for `bot.completed` and `bot.failed` events
- **Same payload**: Uses the same payload structure as webhooks

### Configuring Callbacks

When creating a bot, include the `callback_config` in your request:

```json
{
  "bot_name": "My Bot",
  "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/...",
  "callback_enabled": true,
  "callback_config": {
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "method": "POST",
    "secret": "your-secret-key"
  }
}
```

### Callback Security

If you provide a `secret` in `callback_config`, it will be included in the `x-mb-secret` header of all callback requests. Use this to verify that callbacks are coming from Meeting BaaS.

### Retrying Callbacks

If a callback delivery fails, you can retry it using the `POST /v2/bots/:bot_id/retry-callback` endpoint.

## Resending Webhooks

If a webhook delivery fails, you can resend it using the `POST /v2/bots/:bot_id/resend-webhook` endpoint.
