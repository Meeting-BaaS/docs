When a bot fails, the error information is included in the `bot.failed` webhook event and in the bot details response. This page documents all possible error codes and their meanings.

## Error Code Structure

Error codes are standardized strings that indicate the reason a bot failed. They are included in:

- `bot.failed` webhook events (`error_code` field)
- Bot details response (`error_code` field)
- Bot status history

## Normal End Reasons

These codes indicate the bot ended normally (not a failure):

### `BOT_REMOVED`

### `NO_ATTENDEES`
**Title:** No Attendees  
**Description:** No attendees joined the meeting.

### `NO_SPEAKER`
**Title:** No Speaker  
**Description:** No speakers detected during recording.

### `RECORDING_TIMEOUT`
**Title:** Recording Timeout  
**Description:** Recording timeout reached.

### `API_REQUEST`
**Title:** API Request  
**Description:** Recording stopped via API request (using the leave endpoint).

## Error End Reasons

These codes indicate the bot failed due to an error:

### `BOT_NOT_ACCEPTED`
**Title:** Bot Not Accepted  
**Description:** Bot was not accepted into the meeting, either by the participants or the meeting platform.

**Token Charging:** Only recording tokens are charged (based on waiting room duration).

### `TIMEOUT_WAITING_TO_START`

### `STREAMING_SETUP_FAILED`
**Title:** Streaming Setup Failed  
**Description:** Failed to set up streaming audio.

### `LOGIN_REQUIRED`
**Title:** Login Required  
**Description:** Login required to access the meeting.

### `INTERNAL_ERROR`

**Description:** Internal error occurred during recording.

## Crash Reasons

These codes indicate the bot process crashed:

### `OOM_KILLED`

## Transcription Errors

### `TRANSCRIPTION_FAILED`
**Title:** Transcription Failed  
**Description:** The transcription process failed. Please try again using re-transcribe endpoint or contact support.

**Token Charging:** Recording and streaming tokens are charged, but transcription tokens are not.

## Zoom-Specific Errors

These errors are specific to Zoom meetings:

### `WAITING_FOR_HOST_TIMEOUT`
**Title:** Waiting for Host Timeout
**Description:** The bot timed out while waiting for the meeting host to join the meeting.

**OBF Context:** When using OBF tokens, this error also occurs if the **authorized user** (the Zoom user who authorized your app) does not join the meeting within the timeout period. The bot retries joining every few seconds, but if the authorized user never appears, this timeout is triggered.

**Resolution:** Ensure the authorized user joins the meeting before or shortly after the bot. You can increase the timeout via `timeout_config.waiting_room_timeout`.

### `RECORDING_RIGHTS_NOT_GRANTED`
**Title:** Recording Rights Not Granted  
**Description:** The bot was unable to obtain recording rights from the meeting host.

### `CANNOT_REQUEST_RECORDING_RIGHT`
**Title:** Cannot Request Recording Right  
**Description:** The bot could not request recording rights. The meeting may not have recording enabled.

### `EXITING_MEETING_BEFORE_RECORD`
**Title:** Exiting Meeting Before Record  
**Description:** The meeting ended before the bot could start recording.

### `MEETING_ENDED_PREMATURELY`
**Title:** Meeting Ended Prematurely  
**Description:** The meeting ended before the bot could participate.

### `SET_ZOOM_ID_AND_PWD_TOGETHER`
**Title:** Zoom SDK Configuration Error  
**Description:** Zoom SDK ID and password must be set together.

### `CANNOT_GET_JWT_TOKEN`
**Title:** Cannot Get JWT Token  
**Description:** Unable to obtain JWT token with the provided Zoom SDK credentials.

### `SDK_AUTH_FAILED`
**Title:** SDK Authentication Failed  
**Description:** Zoom SDK authentication failed with the provided credentials.

### `ZOOM_ACCESS_TOKEN_ERROR`
**Title:** Zoom Access Token Error
**Description:** An error occurred while obtaining the Zoom access token (ZAK token). This can happen when using `zak_token_url` and the endpoint fails to return a valid token.

### `ZOOM_OBF_TOKEN_ERROR`
**Title:** Zoom OBF Token Error
**Description:** An error occurred while obtaining or using the OBF (On Behalf Of) token. This can happen when:

- The `obf_token` provided is invalid or expired
- The `obf_token_url` endpoint fails to return a valid token
- The stored credential (`credential_id`) has invalid or expired OAuth tokens
- Token refresh fails for managed OAuth credentials

**Resolution:** Check your OBF token configuration. If using stored credentials, verify the credential state is "active" via `GET /v2/zoom-credentials/{id}`. If the credential is invalid, prompt the user to re-authorize.

### `RECORDING_START_TIMEOUT`
**Title:** Recording Start Timeout
**Description:** Recording privilege was granted by the host, but the recording never started within the expected time. This may indicate an issue with the meeting platform's recording system.

**Token Charging:** Recording tokens are charged based on the time spent waiting.

### `HOST_CLIENT_CANNOT_GRANT_PERMISSION`
**Title:** Host Client Cannot Grant Permission
**Description:** The meeting host is using a Zoom client (such as Zoom Rooms) that cannot display the recording permission dialog. The bot cannot record this meeting.

**Resolution:** This is a limitation of certain Zoom clients. The host would need to join from a standard Zoom desktop or mobile client to grant recording permission.

## System Errors

These errors occur when the system attempts to create a bot instance. For immediate bots, this happens at creation time and the error is returned in the API response. For scheduled and calendar bots, these errors can appear in `bot.failed` webhook events when the bot is being queued to join the meeting (at its scheduled join time).

### `INSUFFICIENT_TOKENS`
**Title:** Insufficient Tokens  
**Description:** Not enough tokens were available to launch the bot.

**When it occurs:**
- **Immediate bots**: When you call `POST /v2/bots` (error returned in API response)
- **Scheduled bots**: When the bot is being queued at its `join_at` time (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)
- **Calendar bots**: When the bot is being queued at its scheduled join time (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)

### `DAILY_BOT_CAP_REACHED`
**Title:** Daily Bot Cap Reached  
**Description:** The daily bot creation limit configured for this team has been reached.

**When it occurs:**
- **Immediate bots**: When you call `POST /v2/bots` (error returned in API response)
- **Scheduled bots**: When the bot is being queued at its `join_at` time (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)
- **Calendar bots**: When the bot is being queued at its scheduled join time (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)

**Note:** For scheduled and calendar bots, the daily bot cap is checked when the bot is being queued, not when it's scheduled. This means a bot scheduled for later in the day might fail if the daily cap is reached before its scheduled time.

### `BOT_ALREADY_EXISTS`
**Title:** Bot Already Exists  
**Description:** A bot is already running for this meeting URL.

**When it occurs:**
- **Immediate bots**: When you call `POST /v2/bots` and `allow_multiple_bots` is `false` (error returned in API response)
- **Scheduled bots**: When the bot is being queued and another bot already exists for the same meeting URL (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)
- **Calendar bots**: When the bot is being queued and another bot already exists for the same meeting URL (error sent via `bot.failed` webhook)

## Unknown Error

### `UNKNOWN_ERROR`
**Title:** Unknown Error  
**Description:** An unknown error occurred. Please contact support.

This is a fallback error code used when the actual error cannot be determined or mapped to a known error code.

## Token Charging

Different error codes result in different token charges:

- **User-responsible errors** (`BOT_NOT_ACCEPTED`, `TIMEOUT_WAITING_TO_START`): Only recording tokens charged (based on waiting room duration)
- **Transcription errors** (`TRANSCRIPTION_FAILED`): Recording and streaming tokens charged, transcription tokens not charged
- **Other errors**: No tokens charged (reserved tokens are released)
- **Normal end reasons**: Full tokens charged based on meeting duration and features used

## Handling Errors

When you receive a `bot.failed` webhook:

1. Check the `error_code` to understand what went wrong
2. Review the `error_message` for additional context
3. For user-responsible errors (`BOT_NOT_ACCEPTED`, `TIMEOUT_WAITING_TO_START`), ensure meeting settings allow bots
4. For transcription errors, you can retry transcription using the re-transcribe endpoint
5. For system errors, check your token balance and daily bot cap
6. For unknown errors, contact support with the bot ID and error details
