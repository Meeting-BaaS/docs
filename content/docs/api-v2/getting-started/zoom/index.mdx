# Zoom Integration

Meeting BaaS v2 provides enhanced Zoom integration with secure credential management, improved OBF token handling, and better error tracking.

<Callout type="warn">
**March 2, 2026 Deadline:** Zoom requires OBF tokens for bots joining external meetings. If your bots join meetings hosted by external Zoom accounts, you must implement OBF tokens before this date. See [OBF Token Support](/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) for details.
</Callout>

## What's New in v2

The v2 API introduces several improvements for Zoom integration:

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| **Credential Storage** | Separate OAuth connection endpoint | Unified `/v2/zoom-credentials` API |
| **SDK Credentials** | Passed with each bot request | Store once, reference by ID |
| **Encryption** | Basic | AES-256-GCM for secrets and tokens |
| **Credential Types** | OAuth only | App-only (SDK) and User (OAuth) |
| **State Tracking** | Limited | Active/Invalid with error tracking |
| **Configuration** | Multiple top-level params | Single `zoom_config` object |

## Two Approaches

How you integrate with Zoom depends on whose meetings your bots join:

  <Card title="Internal Meetings" href="/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/credentials#app-only-credentials">
    Bots join meetings within your Zoom organization. Store SDK credentials once and reference them in bot requests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Meetings" href="/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens">
    Bots join meetings hosted by external accounts. OBF tokens required after March 2, 2026.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Your Use Case | What You Need | Documentation |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Recording your team's meetings | App-only credentials | [Zoom Credentials](/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/credentials) |
| Building a product for customers | User credentials with OBF | [OBF Token Support](/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) |
| Joining meetings hosted by others | OBF tokens | [OBF Token Support](/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) |
| Already managing OAuth yourself | Direct token or Token URL | [OBF Token Support](/docs/api-v2/getting-started/zoom/obf-tokens) |

## The `zoom_config` Object

In v2, all Zoom-specific configuration is passed in a single `zoom_config` object:

```json
{
  "bot_name": "Recording Bot",
  "meeting_url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
  "zoom_config": {
    "credential_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
  }
}
```

Available options within `zoom_config`:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `credential_id` | UUID of a stored credential (recommended for most use cases) |
| `credential_user_id` | Look up stored credential by Zoom user ID |
| `obf_token` | Direct OBF token for one-off joins |
| `obf_token_url` | URL that returns an OBF token at join time |
| `zak_token_url` | URL that returns a ZAK token for host-level access |

## Key Concepts

### Credential Types

**App-only credentials** store your Zoom app's SDK credentials (client ID and secret). Use these when your bots only join internal meetings.

**User credentials** store OAuth tokens for a specific Zoom user who authorized your app. These enable OBF token support for joining external meetings.

### Credential States

v2 tracks credential health:

- **active**: Credential is working and can be used
- **invalid**: Credential has failed (e.g., tokens revoked, refresh failed)

When a credential becomes invalid, `last_error_message` and `last_error_at` provide debugging information.

### Security

All credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Client secrets and OAuth tokens are never returned in API responses—only credential IDs and metadata.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I migrate my v1 Zoom OAuth connections to v2?**

Yes, but you'll need to create new credentials in v2 using the `/v2/zoom-credentials` endpoint. We recommend having users re-authorize to ensure fresh tokens.

**Q: Do I need to change my Zoom app configuration?**

No, your existing Zoom app works with v2. The scopes and settings remain the same.

**Q: What happens if a credential becomes invalid?**

Bots using that credential will fail to join meetings. You'll see the error in the credential's `last_error_message` field and in the bot's failure webhook.

**Q: Can I use both v1 and v2 APIs simultaneously?**

Yes, during migration you can use both APIs. However, credentials are not shared between v1 and v2—you'll need to set them up separately.
