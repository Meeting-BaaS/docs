# Removing a Bot

You can remove a bot from a meeting or delete bot data using the v2 API. There are two operations:

1. **Leave meeting**: Instruct a bot to leave the meeting immediately (while it's active)
2. **Delete data**: Permanently delete a bot and all its data (after it's completed or failed)

## Leave Meeting

To instruct a bot to leave the meeting immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID/leave" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Bot leave request sent successfully."
  }
}
```

### When Can You Leave a Bot?

The leave endpoint can only be called when the bot is in one of these statuses:

- `joining_call`: Bot is attempting to join the meeting
- `in_waiting_room`: Bot is waiting in the meeting's waiting room
- `in_call_not_recording`: Bot is in the meeting but not recording
- `in_call_recording`: Bot is actively recording
- `recording_paused`: Bot recording is paused
- `recording_resumed`: Bot recording has resumed

### Error Responses

**404 Not Found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Bot with ID 'BOT-ID' not found",
  "code": "FST_ERR_BOT_NOT_FOUND_BY_ID",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

**409 Conflict (Bot status doesn't allow leaving):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Status of bot 'BOT-ID' is: completed. Operation not permitted in this state.",
  "code": "FST_ERR_BOT_STATUS",
  "statusCode": 409
}
```

This error occurs when the bot is in a status that doesn't allow leaving, such as:
- `queued`: Bot hasn't started joining yet
- `transcribing`: Bot has left and is processing transcription
- `completed`: Bot has already completed
- `failed`: Bot has already failed

### How It Works

When you call the leave endpoint:
1. The system sends a stop recording command to the bot process
2. The bot stops recording and exits the meeting (usually within a few seconds)
3. The bot will transition to `transcribing` status (if transcription is enabled) or `completed` status
4. A final webhook event (`bot.completed` or `bot.failed`) will be sent when the bot finishes processing

**Note:** The leave command is sent immediately, but the bot may take a few seconds to actually exit the meeting and update its status.

## Delete Bot Data

To permanently delete a bot and all its associated data (recordings, transcriptions, etc.):

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID/delete-data" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "deleted": true
  }
}
```

### When Can You Delete Bot Data?

The delete endpoint can only be called when the bot is in one of these statuses:

- `completed`: Bot has successfully completed recording and processing
- `failed`: Bot has failed

### Error Responses

**404 Not Found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Bot with ID 'BOT-ID' not found",
  "code": "FST_ERR_BOT_NOT_FOUND_BY_ID",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

**409 Conflict (Bot status doesn't allow deletion):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Status of bot 'BOT-ID' is: in_call_recording. Operation not permitted in this state.",
  "code": "FST_ERR_BOT_STATUS",
  "statusCode": 409
}
```

This error occurs when the bot is still active (e.g., `in_call_recording`, `transcribing`, etc.). You must wait for the bot to complete or fail, or use the leave endpoint first.

**Note:** This permanently deletes the bot and all its data. This action cannot be undone.

## Cancel Scheduled Bot

To cancel a scheduled bot before it joins the meeting:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/scheduled/SCHEDULED-BOT-ID" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Note:** You can only cancel scheduled bots that haven't started yet. Once a bot has joined the meeting, you must use the regular delete endpoint.

## Important Notes

- Deleting a bot removes all associated data including recordings, transcriptions, and screenshots
- Deleted bots cannot be recovered
- If a bot is currently recording, deletion will stop the recording and remove all data
- Scheduled bots can be cancelled before they join, but once they've joined, they must be deleted like regular bots
