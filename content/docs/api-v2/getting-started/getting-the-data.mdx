Once a bot completes recording a meeting, you can retrieve the meeting data including recordings, transcriptions, and metadata.

## Getting Bot Details

To get all information about a bot, including artifact URLs:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": "completed",
    "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/...",
    "video": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../video.mp4",
    "audio": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../audio.mp3",
    "transcription": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../transcription.json",
    "diarization": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../diarization.json",
    "participants": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "speakers": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "duration_seconds": 3600,
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Getting Bot Status

For a lightweight status check:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID/status" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": "in_call_recording",
    "transcription_status": "processing",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Getting Screenshots

To get screenshots taken during the meeting:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/v2/bots/BOT-ID/screenshots" \
     -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Note:** Screenshots are only available for Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Zoom does not support screenshots.

## Artifact URLs

All artifact URLs (video, audio, transcription, diarization) are **presigned S3 URLs** that are valid for **4 hours**. Make sure to download them within this time window.

## Recommended Approach

Instead of polling the API, we recommend:

1. **Use webhooks**: Configure webhooks in your account settings to receive `bot.completed` events automatically
2. **Use callbacks**: Provide a `callback_config` when creating the bot to receive notifications for that specific bot
3. **Poll only when necessary**: If you must poll, use a judicious interval (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) and only for reconciliation purposes

For more details, see the [Webhooks documentation](/docs/api-v2/webhooks).
