# Setting Up Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about bot and calendar events without polling the API.

## Overview

Meeting BaaS v2 uses [SVIX](https://www.svix.com/) for reliable webhook delivery. Webhooks are configured at the account level and will receive notifications for all events.

## Configuring Webhooks

Webhooks are configured through your account settings (not via the API). Once configured, you'll receive webhook events for:

- Bot status changes
- Bot completion
- Bot failures
- Calendar events (connections, syncs, event changes)

## Webhook Events

### Bot Events

- `bot.status_change`: Triggered when a bot's status changes
- `bot.completed`: Triggered when a bot successfully completes
- `bot.failed`: Triggered when a bot fails

### Calendar Events

- `calendar.connection_created`: New calendar connection created
- `calendar.connection_updated`: Calendar connection updated
- `calendar.connection_deleted`: Calendar connection deleted
- `calendar.connection_error`: Calendar connection error
- `calendar.events_synced`: Calendar events synced - When a calendar syncs for the first time
- `calendar.event_created`: New calendar event created
- `calendar.event_updated`: Calendar event updated
- `calendar.event_cancelled`: Calendar event cancelled

For detailed information about each event type, see the [Webhooks documentation](/docs/api-v2/webhooks).

## Webhook Security

All webhooks are signed using SVIX's signature verification. Verify webhooks using:

- `svix-id`: Unique message ID
- `svix-timestamp`: Timestamp of the message
- `svix-signature`: Signature for verification

Use SVIX's verification libraries to verify webhook signatures in your code.

## Callbacks

In addition to account-level webhooks, you can also configure **callbacks** per-bot when creating a bot. Callbacks are direct HTTP requests sent to a URL you specify, and are only sent for `bot.completed` and `bot.failed` events.

See the [Webhooks documentation](/docs/api-v2/webhooks) for more details on callbacks.
