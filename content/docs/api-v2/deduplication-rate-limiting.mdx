Meeting BaaS v2 includes built-in protection against duplicate bots and rate limiting to ensure fair usage.

## Deduplication

Deduplication prevents multiple bots from joining the same meeting within a short time window.

### How It Works

By default, when you create a bot with `allow_multiple_bots: false`, the system:

1. Checks if a bot already exists for the same meeting URL within the last 5 minutes
2. If a bot exists, the request fails with `BOT_ALREADY_EXISTS`
3. If no bot exists, a lock is acquired and the bot is created

### Lock Duration

The deduplication lock lasts for **5 minutes**. After this time, you can create another bot for the same meeting URL.

### Allowing Multiple Bots

If you want to allow multiple bots in the same meeting, set `allow_multiple_bots: true` when creating the bot:

```json
{
  "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "bot_name": "Bot 1",
  "allow_multiple_bots": true
}
```

With `allow_multiple_bots: true`, no deduplication lock is applied, and multiple bots can join the same meeting.

### Use Cases

**Prevent duplicates (`allow_multiple_bots: false`):**
- Production environments where duplicate bots are unwanted
- Preventing accidental double-booking
- Ensuring only one bot per meeting

**Allow multiple bots (`allow_multiple_bots: true`):**
- Testing scenarios
- Multiple recording perspectives
- Backup bots for reliability

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting controls how many requests per second your team can make to the API.

### How It Works

- Rate limits are applied **per team** (not per API key)
- Limits are measured in **requests per second**
- **GET requests are not rate limited** (list and get endpoints)
- Only POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests are rate limited

### Default Rate Limits

Default rate limits vary by plan:

- **Pay-as-you-go**: 1 request/second
- **Pro**: 1 request/second
- **Scale**: 1 request/second
- **Enterprise**: 20 requests/second

### Rate Limit Headers

When making requests, the API includes rate limit headers:

- `x-ratelimit-limit`: Maximum requests per second
- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window
- `x-ratelimit-reset`: Time when the rate limit resets
- `retry-after`: Seconds to wait before retrying (when limit exceeded)

### Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "code": "FST_ERR_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "statusCode": 429
}
```

The response includes a `retry-after` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

### Best Practices

1. **Respect rate limits**: Implement exponential backoff when you receive 429 errors
2. **Use batch operations**: Create multiple bots in a single request instead of multiple individual requests
3. **Cache responses**: Cache GET requests to reduce API calls
4. **Monitor headers**: Check rate limit headers to understand your current usage

## Daily Bot Cap

In addition to rate limiting, each team has a **daily bot creation limit**:

- **Pay-as-you-go**: 75 bots/day
- **Pro**: 300 bots/day
- **Scale**: 1,000 bots/day
- **Enterprise**: 3,000 bots/day

### How It Works

- The daily bot cap is checked **before** creating each bot
- The limit is based on a 24-hour rolling window
- If the limit is reached, subsequent bot creation requests fail with `DAILY_BOT_CAP_REACHED`
- The cap resets based on when bots were created (not a fixed time)

### Error Response

When the daily bot cap is reached:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Daily bot cap has been reached: 75 bots created within the last 24 hours",
  "code": "FST_ERR_DAILY_BOT_CAP_REACHED",
  "statusCode": 429
}
```

## Combining Limits

All limits work together:

1. **Rate limiting**: Controls requests per second
2. **Daily bot cap**: Controls total bots per day
3. **Token availability**: Controls whether you have tokens to create bots
4. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate bots (if enabled)

Make sure to account for all these limits when designing your integration.
