API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Meeting BaaS v2 API. Each API key is associated with a team and has specific permissions that determine which endpoints can be accessed.

## API Key Authentication

All v2 API requests must include your API key in the request header:

```http
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY
```

## Permission Types

Meeting BaaS v2 supports two permission types for API keys:

### Full Access

API keys with **Full Access** can perform all operations on all endpoints:

- Create, list, view, update, and delete bots
- Create, list, view, update, and delete scheduled bots
- Manage calendar connections and events
- Schedule and manage calendar bots
- Use all batch operation endpoints
- Manage webhooks and callbacks

**Use cases:**
- Complete application integration
- Administrative operations
- Calendar management
- Webhook configuration
- Data management and cleanup

### Sending Access

API keys with **Sending Access** are designed for bot creation only. They can only send POST requests to bot creation endpoints:

**Allowed endpoints:**
- `POST /v2/bots` - Create a bot
- `POST /v2/bots/batch` - Create multiple bots
- `POST /v2/bots/scheduled` - Schedule a bot
- `POST /v2/bots/scheduled/batch` - Schedule multiple bots
- `POST /v2/calendars/:calendar_id/bots` - Schedule a bot for a calendar event

**Not allowed:**
- Any GET requests (including listing bots, getting bot details, checking status)
- Any PATCH or DELETE requests
- Calendar management endpoints
- Webhook or callback management

**Use cases:**
- Dedicated bot creation services
- Third-party integrations that only need to send bots
- Limited-scope applications
- Security isolation (prevents accidental data deletion or viewing)

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits are applied per team (not per API key). The rate limit determines how many requests per second your team can make. GET requests are not rate limited.

Default rate limits vary by plan, but can be customized for enterprise customers.

## Daily Bot Cap

Each team has a daily bot creation limit (e.g., 75 bots/day for pay-as-you-go, 300 for pro). This limit is checked before creating each bot. If the limit is reached, subsequent bot creation requests will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

The daily bot cap resets every 24 hours based on when bots were created.

## Best Practices

1. **Use separate API keys for different environments** (development, staging, production)
2. **Use Sending Access for public-facing services** that only need to create bots
3. **Rotate API keys regularly** for security
4. **Store API keys securely** - never commit them to version control
5. **Monitor your daily bot cap** to avoid hitting limits

## Error Responses

If an API key lacks permission for an endpoint, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "code": "FST_ERR_FORBIDDEN",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```
