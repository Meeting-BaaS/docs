## Production Updates

### Streaming Format Specification

We've added the ability to specify the streaming format for WebSocket streams. You can now choose between 16kHz or 24kHz audio frequency.

```json
{
  "audio_frequency": "16khz" // or "24khz"
}
```

### Microsoft Teams Client Update

Our Microsoft Teams client has undergone a major overhaul, reducing the number of bugs by 50%. It now supports live Teams links, including Microsoft Live Meeting URLs (e.g., `https://teams.live.com/meet/...`).

### Google Meet Client Update

We've updated our Google Meet client, reducing the number of bugs by 10%.

### Zoom Client Update

We've released an entirely new Zoom client. While video capture isn't supported yet, we plan to release this feature within the next two weeks. Zoom is expected to be our most stable client.
