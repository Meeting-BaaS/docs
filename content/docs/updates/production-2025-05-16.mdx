# Frontend Logs UI Removal and Navigation Updates

> üêü Looks like we're streamlining our UI - no more fishing around in those old log components! 

## Overview

This update focuses on removing the legacy logs interface from the webapp and updating navigation to point to the new external logs portal. The changes primarily affect frontend components and internal routing, with no modifications to API endpoints or bot integrations.

The following UI components have been removed:

- Logs table and related components
- Search functionality
- Filter components
- Date filtering
- CSV export capabilities

  },
  dateRange: {
    description: 'Updated import path for getPresetRange utility',
    type: 'function',
    default: 'N/A'
  }
}} />

<Callout type="info">
All changes are frontend-only and maintain compatibility with external services. The logs functionality has been migrated to a dedicated portal for improved user experience.
</Callout>

# External Logs Navigation Flow

> üêü Something's fishy about these logs... they're swimming in a new tab! (Get it? Because MeetingBaaS sounds like Meeting Bass?) 

This documentation describes the user interface flows for accessing external logs through our system.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Main Navigation Flow" value="main-flow">
    The primary flow for accessing external logs:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant ExternalLogs
    User->>App: Clicks "Logs" in menu
    App->>ExternalLogs: Opens https://logs.meetingbaas.com/ in new tab
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Back Navigation Behavior" value="back-flow">
    When users click the "Back" button in the logs viewer:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Viewer
    participant ExternalLogs
    User->>Viewer: Clicks "Back" in Viewer
    alt Window has opener
    Viewer->>User: Attempt to close tab
    Note right of Viewer: If not closed after 500ms
    Viewer->>ExternalLogs: Redirect to https://logs.meetingbaas.com/
    else No opener
    Viewer->>ExternalLogs: Redirect to https://logs.meetingbaas.com/
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout type="info">
  The external logs viewer always opens in a new browser tab to maintain separation from the main application context.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  If the tab fails to close automatically after clicking "Back", the system will redirect to the main logs dashboard.
</Callout>
