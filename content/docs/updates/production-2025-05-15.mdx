# Infrastructure Updates - May 15, 2025 üêü

> Something's fishy with our Nginx config... but in a good way! Our logs and credentials are now swimming to their own subdomains. 

<Callout type="info">
  These changes involve internal infrastructure updates to improve routing and access management.
</Callout>

## Overview

This update includes significant changes to our Nginx configuration, affecting how certain internal services are accessed. The main changes introduce dedicated subdomains for logs and credentials access in both production and pre-production environments.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Key Changes" value="changes">
    * New redirect rules for `/logs` and `/credentials` paths
    * Implementation of dedicated subdomains for service access
    * Enhanced routing configuration for production and pre-production
    * Improved navigation structure for internal services
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Details" value="details">
    The following modifications were made to the Nginx configuration:

    ```nginx
    # Production Environment
    location /logs {
        return 301 https://logs.domain.com$request_uri;
    }

    location /credentials {
        return 301 https://credentials.domain.com$request_uri;
    }

    # Pre-production Environment
    # Similar configuration with pre-prod domains
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Implementation Notes

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Routing Updates**
    
    All requests to `/logs` and `/credentials` paths are now automatically redirected to their respective subdomains.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Environment Support**
    
    The configuration changes apply to both production and pre-production environments, ensuring consistent behavior across deployments.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Legacy Support**
    
    Previous proxy configurations have been preserved (commented) for reference and potential rollback scenarios.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  Users accessing logs or credentials through the main domain will be automatically redirected to the new dedicated subdomains.

# Infrastructure Update: Nginx Subdomain Redirects

> üêü Something's fishy about these redirects... looks like we're swimming upstream to better subdomains! Let's dive into the changes...

## Overview

This update implements Nginx configuration changes to handle subdomain redirects for logs and credentials endpoints in both production and pre-production environments.

<Callout type="info">
  These changes affect how requests are redirected to specialized subdomains, improving service organization and accessibility.
