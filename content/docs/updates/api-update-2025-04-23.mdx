We're excited to announce several improvements to our API endpoints.

## Bots

### [GET /bots/with/metadata](/docs/api/reference/bots_with_metadata)

Simplified and improved the bot listing endpoint:

- Streamlined response format for better readability
- Maintains all filtering capabilities (`meeting_url`, `bot_name`, `created_after/before`, `speaker_name`)
- Supports advanced filtering and sorting through `filter_by_extra` and `sort_by_extra`
- Returns essential metadata including IDs, names, and meeting details

### [GET /bots/:uuid/screenshots](/docs/api/reference/get_screenshots)

New endpoint to retrieve screenshots captured during a bot's session:

- Access screenshots taken while trying to access meetings
- Useful for monitoring and verification purposes
- Part of our expanded bot monitoring capabilities

## Webhooks

### GET /webhooks/calendar/webhook/documentation

Documentation improvements and parameter updates:

- Updated parameter notation from `{uuid}` to `:uuid` for consistency with REST API standards
- Clarified the `affected_event_uuids` field documentation
- Enhanced integration examples with calendar events
- All endpoint references now use `:parameter` notation

## Implementation Timeline

These changes will be live in production on April 24th, 2025. The updates focus on improving documentation clarity, adding new monitoring capabilities, and maintaining consistent API patterns across our endpoints.
