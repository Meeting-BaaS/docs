# Microsoft Teams Integration

<Callout type="info">July 2nd, 2023</Callout>

We're excited to announce that Meeting BaaS now integrates with Microsoft Teams.

This integration allows your application to:

- Create and schedule Teams meetings
- Generate participant links
- Modify existing meetings
- Join as a participant or moderator
- Control in-meeting experience

## Getting Started

To use the Microsoft Teams integration, check our [Microsoft Teams API documentation](/docs/guides/microsoft-teams) for details on authentication, endpoints, and examples.

If you're using our TypeScript SDK, you can access these features through the `MicrosoftTeams` class.

```typescript
import { MeetingBaaS } from '@meeting-baas/sdk';

const api = new MeetingBaaS({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});

// Create a Microsoft Teams meeting
const meeting = await api.microsoftTeams.createMeeting({
  title: 'Product Demo',
  startTime: new Date('2023-07-10T15:00:00Z'),
  endTime: new Date('2023-07-10T16:00:00Z'),
});
```
