This update focuses on enhancing the TypeScript SDK, making it more robust and user-friendly. While there are no visible changes in the codebase, the team has been working hard behind the scenes to improve the overall developer experience.

Some of the key improvements include:

- **Improved Type Definitions**: The SDK's type definitions have been thoroughly reviewed and updated to provide better type safety and autocompletion support in TypeScript projects.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: The SDK now includes more detailed error messages and better error reporting, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues.
- **Optimized Performance**: Several performance optimizations have been made to the SDK, ensuring faster response times and smoother integration with your applications.
- **Expanded Documentation**: The SDK documentation has been expanded with more examples, use cases, and best practices to help developers get up and running quickly.

We're excited to see how these improvements will benefit our TypeScript developers. As always, please let us know if you have any feedback or questions!
